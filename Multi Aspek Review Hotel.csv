0,"Awesome Everything about this resort was great. My wife and I had such a wonderful time that we are already looking for flights to go back. The resort is spectacular! The staff is extremely friendly and they were all very helpful. Everywhere we went the folks were really nice, either the bar, the beach, the front desk, room service or house cleaning. It's a really great place for couples because of the location of the hotel, which is in south Puerto Rico, far far away from the hectic hustle and bustle of San Juan. And because it's so far away from the high-traffic, high-pollution San Juan, the weather is much better than San Juan. We landed in San Juan and it was raining. Then we went on a one-day trip to San Juan and it was raining. Then on the flight back, it was raining again in San Juan. We stayed in Ponce 6 days and it DID NOT rain even once. The closest it got was a bit overcast in the evening one night. The breakfast is awesome! The other two restaurants at the resort are awesome! We had so much fun that we didn't even go to the Casino. We highly recommend this resort for anyone looking for a romantic getaway or with a family with kids.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
1,"Convenient  When I say Above Average I'm comparing to sparse alternative offerings in the Ponce area (and being an avid golfer, this place having no competition in the south central portion to the island). The resort was easy to get to and conveniently located, but it (in the greater worldwide scheme of things) wasn't anything close to special. Furthermore (aside from the outstanding 27 hole on site golf course), it was not redeeming other than it was situated on the ocean (to be more precise, the Carribean Sea) and had two separate pool and beach areas (one moderate size family pool with large beach area at hotel, and another dazzling adult pool with small beach area at the golf course clubhouse complex). We ate out in town, but availed ourselves to the bar lounge area (good, but expensive mixed drinks and beer) and to the casino (okay, but not exciting and no Vegas - or Mesquite, for that matter). The rooms were clean and all have a view toward the ocean overlooking the gardened grounds, but it was not spacious or memorable. At this low season stay, we still had to pay a AAA rate of $160 and pony up an extra $8 parking fee (for the priviledge of parking in one of several hundred unsused spaces in a cavernous parking lot) as well as a $11+ resort fee (were told to pay for groundskeeping costs). All in all, this single night stay (and playing the full 27 holes of golf) was fine and dandy, but it doesn't beckon to me to pay a return visit.",1.0,1.0,1.0,,-1.0

3,"Always a 5 star stay! Its always a good trip when you stay at the Ponce Hilton in Ponce Puerto Rico. I just spent 4 days and 3 nights at this facility and as usual I found it clean, the staff extremely friendly, and there was nothing you could need that was not available. Granted this is a 5 star resort, so if your looking for a bare bones cheap stay this is not the place. But if you want to be catered to, have the staff not only know who you are but be able to address you by name. If you want every possible type of food in what ever amount you want at a moments notice. If you want immediate access to 5 restaurants and 7 bars, a business center and an executive lounge. If you want full service spa's, training areas, casinos, night clubs, etc. then this is the place for you! If this sound like your kind of place the run, don't walk to the Costa Caribe Ponce Hilton.",,,1.0,,1.0
4,Loved It! The hotel is beautiful with spectacular views. Staff are friendly and kind. I've seen remarks written about the double beds and it is true. Double beds not much larger than a single. Our room was right off the pool and feet from the beach. Retrieving the car was simple and quick. The breakfast was great. I would definitely come back. The only major thing we had a problem with but through no fault of the hotel was the putrid smell from the Don Q rum factory. It's enough to make you upchuck. Other than that - GREAT TIME.

5,"Wonderful Hotel!!! This hotel was great! The room was immaculate, the sheets  bedspreads (which I'm very picky about) were plush, soft, super clean, no complaints about that. The room itself, when I first walked in, smelled deodorized  properly kept.The pool area was beautiful, the terrace with the colossal columns  dangling lights contributes to a feel of tropical elegance. Gym was OK, but would like them to add more treadmills. But the crown of our stay was the Rest La Cava. As soon as we walked in, the services just outstanding. The waiter  host were professional and proper, yet friendly. They were about to close the restaurant, but decided to cater to us regardless. We contemplated the bottles of wines (and the price tags) of wines from all over the world. The food was fresh, and elegantly served. The souffle for dessert, I still crave to this day its delicious grand manier flavor. Would definitely go back! My husband, my boys (teenagers) really enjoyed the stay and would definitely go back.",1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0
6,"A great resort destination! I loved my two-week stay here! Great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Everything is open, and walking around the hotel at midnight is commonplace. It is an open community, with an excellent swimming pool, comfortable rooms, and a great location! The price could be hefty, but if you are on vacation, splurging (moderately) is not a big big issue! Enjoy your stay.",1.0,1.0,,,1.0
7,"Best Pina Coladas in all of Puerto Rico The one thing about this hotel is...Best Pina Coladas in all of Puerto Rico. The resort could use a remodel. It is dated. The staff at the front desk is friendly. The rooms are okay, definitely not U.S. standards for cleanliness. The fine dining restaurant is expensive but very romantic and has good food. There is nothing in Ponce to do. We went to the boardwalk marina area but it was boring. No shops or restaurants. Just a bunch of bars that were the size of a tool shed. I would not go back to this resort.",1.0,,-1.0,1.0,1.0
8,"crappy hotel This hotel was not so good on almost all levels. The buffet at terraza was just thawed, pre frozen food....not fresh. Yuck. The service: horrible. I had reserved the suite suitable for 6 people and then gave my room to someone else then gave me (without asking me first) a room suitable for 2 people. When i came back to the desk to explain it took almost 2 hours to correct the problem, which they said was now 3 rooms in the executive tower. But they didn't mention that one room had a murphy bed with no blankets! ahh. The beach here is almost not swim worthy. It is black sand and covered in rocks. The pool is WAY overcrowded. Basically, if you want to stay in a hilton, stay at Hilton Caribe in San Juan. EVERYTHING is better there.",-1.0,,-1.0,,-1.0
9,"Only good thing was golf. The hotel only has one pool that was extremely overcrowded with people, the other pool was in the golf club which is about a 5 minute drive, I would recommend the golf course, it was beautiful. But the actual hotel looked like it hadn't been renovated since the 80's,  it was not very clean, our room smelled like a bad car freshner, we didn't even have a duvet cover on our bed there were just two sheets wrapped around the dirty comforter, the food was just OK, I guess I just expect more when you are paying 250 a night.",-1.0,,-1.0,,-1.0
10,Wonderful and Quiet Hotel! We stayed at the Ponce Hilton for six nights. The hotel was easy to get to from the San Juan airport. The hotel staff was very friendly. The room was very large and clean. The king size bed was very comfortable. I would recommend staying in the Executive Towers because you have access to a continental breakfast and the Internet in the executive lounge. I highly recommend eating at Sancho's Sushi at the hotel. They have the best sushi and the service was awesome! Definitely rent a car when staying in Puerto Rico. There are so many beautiful beaches around the country within several miles. There are tolls on some of the roads so make sure you have quarters. Driving is simple as long as you stay on the main highways. Once you start getting off the main highways the roads are very narrow and scary. Puerto Rico is a beautiful country.,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0

13,"3 Star hotel pretending to be a 5 star hotel Beware. This hotel pretends to be considered 5 stars, but at best they are a 3 star with ocean view. The service ranges from OK to mediocre, and the food is very expensive. The rooms are nothing to die for, and the main lobby is way too dark considering the extremely elevated crime rate of the area. If you are driving to the property you'll have to pay a parking fee. The interesting fact is that they have no personnel at the gate because a bunch of crooks assaulted them with shotguns and took all the money from their petty cash (a hotel employee actually told me this fact). So yes, crime will be at your doorstep, so be extremely careful and on the lookout.Some of the hotel staff are nice, but in general they don't make you feel welcome to the place.",-1.0,,,,-1.0
14,"Great get Away Just got back after 4 night stay. The hotel itself is great , exceptionally clean, well maintained and quiet. There are staff members that need to be trained in hospitality and being cordial. They have a little casino which caters mostly to locals and unfortunately theres a lot of nepotism. Customer grievances are handled hap-hazardly and unprofessionally. The wait staff really try to treat customers like family and do a fantastic job. The casino rates players but All I was able to get after 4 days of blackjack at $10 a hand was 4 virgin pina coladas, I took them. The slots are just tight . Since its that nicest hotel in the area I don't have much to choose from. Since my family lives in the area I have to deal with it. If you come here hope for a positve experience but remember youv'e been warned. It's in a isolated spot, there plenty of sun but beach is like volcanic ash. They charged $4.50 for guests to park overnight even thoough I was in the casino playing but locals have parking validated. They charge a $11.90 resort tax and there are no boats, kayaks or beach toys. They have a little gym and restaurants I did not patronize. A day trip to Ponce area can be done in three hours.",1.0,,1.0,,-1.0
15,"Excellent retreat This is our third visit to Ponce Hilton. In addition to its excellent staff, Ponce Hilton offers many amenities at a reasonable rate. We walked around the grounds (kept very clean) in the morning and used the fitness center and the pool in the main hotel. We did not have time to use the pool at the Clubhouse, but we highly recommend it to those who prefer a quieter setting. Mosquitoes were not a huge problem. The hotel sprayed at night and kept the grounds free of debris. As for food, we had the continental breakfast and lunch at the hotel. The cold breakfast buffet offers numerous choices including fresh fruit, yogurt, soy, juices, cheeses, cereals, pastries, etc. You have the option of a hot breakfast as well. Ponce Hilton is an excellent choice if you plan to explore historic Ponce and Puerto Rico's southern beaches, forests, and other natural preserves. Before you venture out, make sure to stop at the front desk to confirm travel routes and other important information. We were planning to visit Gilligan's Island during our stay but changed our plans based on the information the consierge obtained from the boat operator when she contacted the company on our behalf. The main dock at Gilligan's had been damaged by recent period of heavy rain. The boat was still operating but accessibility was more difficult.",,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
16,"Mosquito and dengue fever My wife and I drove from San Juan to stay 1 night.The hotel is nice but not great. The hotel and rooms are dated modern.Our room was OK, had a fridge, loved the A/C. Being a Diamond VIP, I had a selection of chocolates and strawberry and a large bottle of Fiji water waiting.The hotel has a casino which doesn't even call my attention. A nicely styled outdoor pool, a poor, ratty fitness center, a so-so beach area (watch out for the undertow) with soft, fine dark sand.All rooms are accessed from the exterior. We were in the executive tower which I guess is supposed to be exclusive.NOW, the very bad part: Perhaps due to the recent rains per a local (Ponce is on the leeward side of the island--drier and hotter) or not, but there was a horrendous mosquito invasion that could not be avoided even in the rooms. Despite heavy chemical spraying, they thrived loving the recessed door and patio areas of each room. Did I mention that Puerto Rico is closely monitoring an outbreak of dengue fever? We and others were running and flailing our arms and towels when going outside the rooms--remember all rooms are accessed from the exterior. It truly was horrible. We slept with the A/C fan on high (very impressive), temp set at 60 degrees with the ceiling fan on high over the bed--we slept with the covers covering our heads all because of the mosquitoes.Not even the free night using points was comforting and I still paid for parking.Nothing great at all.",1.0,,-1.0,,-1.0
17,"Wedded Bliss I was getting married at a local mansion, Castillo Serralles about 15 minutes away and felt this would be the best place to host my guests, and did not regret it.We started planning our wedding in March and had continious communication with Enid Montes in customer service. She is by far one of the most helpful persons there. She ensured that our guests got the best accomidations, and catered to their every need. She was also helpful in getting a limo two days before our wedding, and gave wonderful recommendations for local venues.The day of my wedding they allowed me to check into my room in the morning in order to relax and get ready for the chaotic day. My husband and I booked a spa day the day before and the girls at the spa are AMAZING. Gladys and Carla were so friendly and did a wonderful job. On the day of my wedding my stylist cancelled and Gladys was able to acommodate me the morning of the wedding.The room service was a bit slow, but I understood the hotel was hosting two conventions that weekend..so I was not disturbed.In terms of the appearance....I LOVED IT. The pool is open 24 hours a day, and each pool is clean and enough to host children and adults alike. True indeed once you leave the facilities it's not as picturesque as you'd like it to be but in all my travels I've encountered the same experience. I will say that my non Spanish speaking guests were able to get to hotel quickly because it is right off of Highway 2.My husband and I have decided that whenever we go to the enchanted island of Puerto Rico we will have to stay at least one night at the Ponce Hilton. We love it and would recommend the hotel to everyone.",,,1.0,1.0,1.0
18,"Best hotel in the area I have stayed at this hotel at least 15 times and finally decided to write a review. This is nicest hotel in the area. Nice pool area . The beach area is nothing to write home about. After you leave the hotel beach area, the walk along the beach to the city park is nothing more than a garbage dump. I have always stayed on business. The executive lounge area room is a great benefit if you are Hilton Honors Gold. Free internet ,free snacks etc. Rooms are above average.The rooms in the Tower are newer but more walking.self parking only 4.50. Be prepared for slow service in the resturant for dinner. I usually go to the bar for a smaller menu and faster service. All the common areas are non smoking.Slow service in resturants is typical in Puerto Rico.",1.0,,-1.0,,-1.0
19,"I'll be back!!! This past July, we hotel hopped, Stayed in Fajardo, Isla Verde, and Ponce. Staying in Ponce allowed us to visit the central part of the Island (many mountains and incredibly beautiful) wich was only about half hour away. The northern part of Island was about 1 hour away and the West coast 30-45 min drive. We had never stayed at the Hilton, reading the reviews here helped us decide to risk it. Well worth it. Unfortunately, We only spent evenings and mornings there and did not enjoy the facilities enough. The next time down, we will spend more time at the hotel.The rooms were clean, neat and a sort of modern decor. The open lobby invites you to stay and enjoy the ocean breeze. The lower lobby restaurant, seemed to have a formal or semi formal setting, I'll try it next time. Pool was very spacious, many palm trees, and alot of facilities for the kids . Parking is extensive and the casino is entertaining and inexpensive . Staff couldn't be any friendlier. The beach is not good for swimming, but hey, 15-30 min away, you have many beautiful beaches.About 5 minutes south of the hotel is a place called La Guancha they have typical food and music. A beatiufl sunset there (currently my computer's background). The concierge gave us a map of Ponce, we visited downtown. Very historical; the architectural landscape was unbelievable, took some great pictures. People very friendly, a cop on every corner.

Best weather on the island as it seldom rains on this side of the mountains. An easy drive 90 minutes from San Juan. They don't raise their rates during the holidays. Very nice rooms, beautifully landscaped pool area, beach is fair. Good restaurants in Ponce but a little tricky to find your way around downtown. Very nice golf course with 27 holes and very reasonable rates (less than half the golf rates in San Juan). Best value you can find during the holidays.",1.0,1.0,,,

After roughing it for 2 weeks throughout PR and Vieques at relatives bungalows and guest houses, we needed a place with good mattresses, hot water, and cable TV at night. We were pleasantly surprised. The room was spotless and VERY clean. The shower was great. We picked this place because we wanted to enjoy the hotel room and its grounds. We would not be venturing out since we had been out exploring for 2 weeks and just wanted to relax in nice surroundings. (We explored Ponce years ago and that was great too.) We liked the fact that there were no pesky mosquitoes around the grounds. We took the 5 minute shuttle to the golf club pool - it was great too. The only down side was the beach was not a swimming beach. But we were beached out by the time we got there so just having that spectacular oceanview was so peaceful. We had a balcony room.

There are more than enough pool and beach chairs to go around and there are tennis courts and other activities for the guest who wants to be active. The beach is not the greatest because it is quite stony, but if you can get by this, it is a great place to stay. You are near the city and also Route 2 where the major shopping mall is, but you are still far enough away from every day life to hide out if that is what you want.

The adjacent Caribe golf course is a newer 27-hole track with 2 holes oceanside (#18  #27) relatively flat, and unchallenging, unless the winds are up.

Very dry like dessert and dirty. The beach at the Hilton is horrible. We were told beach is black because the rivers empty out into that area. Very ugly beach. The resort is nice. Basketball, ping pong, tennis, nice pool, food on resort very expensive I guess thats why the Hiltons have money and I dont. Also after you pay for room. When you arrive and than check out you have on your bill $7.00 a day resort fee, $4.50 a day for parking or $10.00 a day for valet parking not including tips.

The first night we went to the boardwalk to eat. The drive took only 5 minutes. The next day we went to the town center for a tour, that was only a 10-15 minute drive away. Everything was very close with a rental car and the resort is nice enough to relax onsite during your entire stay. The food is pricey of course, but that's what you should expect at a resort. We never had to walk from the parking area to the hotel, since they always had a person waiting with a golf cart to give us a ride. We enjoyed the live music on Saturday and the quietness on Sunday. The beach isn't the best but we didn't spend time there anyway. Also be sure to take advantage of the (free) bicycles to tour the property and the 2 basketball courts for exercise.

No problem for a bogy golfer if you can stay out of the ponds. Holes #9 ,18 and 27 end on the ocean otherwise there are no other oceanviews.Food was not great . Sat night was an excellent pig roast with local specialties. Other buffet meals were not up to par.But if you are a big eater you will get your moneys worth.Wine list was expensive starting at $44.

36,"Great Location We stayed here for a 4 night city break over New Year 2008/09 on room only basis.The location of the hotel is excellent, being on La Ramblas which is in the centre of the main tourist area and only a couple of hundred metres from the airport bus stop in Pl Catalunya.From the outside the hotel is very clean and well kept and this impression continued inside. Reception was efficient and the staff had a good command of English which is always a help. Our rooms were ground floor at the rear which meant that they were very quiet (La Ramblas is very noisy and I think that front facing rooms might suffer because of this). Being ground floor they also had small terraces which looked a bit claustrophobic but might be OK for a bit of shady peace in the summer.The rooms were fairly standard with twin beds, TV, minibar, bath/shower etc. (but no kettle!). Again these were well kept, clean and reasonably comfortable.We didn't eat in the hotel at all so I can't comment on the food but there are plenty of cafes and restuarants in the area (tip - don't eat in La Ramblas itself but go a couple of streets either side for much better value).The only down side I have for this hotel is that it is very expensive. We wanted a central hotel and accepted that we would have to pay a premium for this. Next time, now that I know my way around Barcelona, I would consider staying further out as the savings on hotel bills would (probably) more than cover bus/metro/taxi fares in and out.",1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0

Though I agree that it can be quite noisy, but it all adds to the atmosphere and we had no trouble sleeping.

The location of the hotel (on the nicer part of La Ramba) is very convenient, and as we had a room overlooking the courtyard, there was no problem with noise.

The room we were in faced onto the Courtyard, which we requested because it was so quiet. The rooms opening out to the Rambla are great for atmosphere, but believe me, Barcelona folk don't go to sleep at night, and the street noise is considerable. The room we were in was very well appointed, the bathroom great. The TV was minimal, to say the least, but it did bring in Sky News, and we weren't in the room that long, anyway. The breakfast was included in our deal, and was excellent. Not worth $30 bucks apiece, if we were paying extra for it, but what breakfast is? If breakfast is not included in your deal, there are lots of cheaper eating places around. BUT, Barcelona is expensive. I confess we ate at the McDonalds on the Rambla one evening, a McDonalds fish sandwich, fries and a coke, and the tab was $9 bucks APIECE. But this is a vote for the Rivoli Rambla, with a special note about the friendliness of the woman on the front desk.",1.0,1.0,,,1.0
41,"Ultra Modern Comfort in the Heart of Barcelona Excuse the belated review!We had a wonderful stay at this hotel.The room was a comfortable size and super-modern, with a flat screen TV, polished wooden floors, impressive attention to detail throughout and my personal favorite - remote control operated blinds (very cool!) It should be noted that there are two wings in the hotel, the modern wing and the traditional wing - I strongly suggest you opt for the modern rooms as traditional appeared to be a flowery way of saying in need of a refurb!You are right in the heart of it all here, with the infamous Las Ramblas on your doorstep - thus quality restuarants, bars and great shopping are never more than a stones throw away.Highly recommended for a short city break.",1.0,,,,
42,Fab Location This hotel would have the best location - on the Ramblas - centre of all restaurants and bars - short walk to the harbour - fab vibe all day and night - that's the only problem all night!!! No double glazed windows here - and the Barcelona vibe goes all night - and you do want to get some sleep - even in Barcelona.

The room was ready on arrival and was very large with a huge balcony with table and chairs. The bathroom was also very big. The room was clean and had everything we needed. However, I did think that it was rather expensive at 120 euros per night, although I suppose you have to remember that this is in a city on the main street in Barcelona. The location was excellent - right on la Ramblas, so everything was nearby. The room was cleaned daily. We did not eat at the hotel as there as so many places to choose from nearby. We did get a coffee in the bar just before we were leaving and I must say that the bar man was incredibly rude - didn't say one word to us at all.

We chose to have a room at the front of the hotel and our room overlooked Las Ramblas. It was great to sit there in the morning watching the world pass by and the street entertainers setting up for the day, but it could be quite noisy at night as the bin men come round about midnight.The breakfast was really nice and loads of choice ranging from breads, pastries, cold meats, fresh fruit and juices but the hot food wasn't up to much and could be sat in the hot well for up to 4 hours.If you're planning a drinking weekend then make sure you take loads of money you can't get 2 drinks for less than 10 Euros.

We stayed in a standard room on the 3rd floor facing La Rambla, and it can get a little noisy at night. Rooms are fairly spacious and clean - cabinet storage space was somewhat limited. The breakfast buffet is nicely done (apart from the scrambled eggs) and has a varied selection - do try to get a table outside on the terrace.

We booked an apartment in Amsterdam so I compromised in Barcelona and boy am I sad I did.The room was very small, the non-opening window provided a view of the backs of some sublimely uninteresting walls, and the service was aloof. Felt like I was intruding when I asked the desk staff for anything. Not one of them knows how to smile. I always hear the French hate Americans and are very rude, but the Spanish have them beat by a landslide.There was a bidet, but being American I have no idea what to use it for when there was a perfectly good shower/tub right next to it. The location on La Rambla is nice. The towels were fluffy. But neither of those justify the price of a multi-star hotel.",-1.0,1.0,,,-1.0

I would not advise it for women travelling alone, the area might make you feel just a little bit uncomfortable after dark, bag snatchers everywhere. Rooms, service and breakfast of ligh standards.

I had an excellent room overlooking Las Ramblas and was more than delighted with the hotel, the staff and the overall service. The room was spotless, the towels changed daily. Yes there was renovation work, the hotel is upgrading floor at a time, but the floor that was being worked on was closed off to residents, and there was no disruption whatsoever. We booked through our local independant travel agent who was able to secure us excellent rates. The internet is not always the cheapest or the most reliable way to book accommodation. The buffet breakfast was adequate. The reception and the bar areas are small, but this is an historic building in the heart of an historic city, so there is going to be limited space.

Excellent balcony to sit out on during the early evening with the no obstructions to the sun and although it wasn't overly noisy, the fact the room was on the front did mean it was possible to hear the sirens and some of the noisier tourists at some peculiar times of the morning. There was ongoing work on the 4th floor and the gym facilities still weren't open. Didn't sample anything extra in this hotel so can't really comment on the service, food or prices.

Specific problems were:Tired Decor, exceptionally rude and scruffy bar staff, warm air only from air-con (indeed it was confirmed by reception that this was common to all rooms), gym and spa closed due to refurbishment (which I note from an earlier post was underway in July 2005), unadvertised local charge for sauna, fee for use of in-room safe and drilling and hammering noise during the day owing to the refurbs.On the plus side the breakfast was one of the best I've had and the location really is prime.If you are getting a good rate at this hotel in comparison to others in the area it may be worth a punt, but in hindsight we would have looked for availability at other 2 or 3 star hotels at the same price point.",-1.0,1.0,,,-1.0

I can only assume that there have been changes to hotel personel since those reviews. I found the reception staff and the porters to be very friendly and helpful but the bar staff were sorely in need of retraining. There was no attempt to make the customer feel welcome. No smiles, no eye contact, no greetings. The drinks were just plonked down silently. There are plenty of pleasant staff in the bars around the Ramblas so we didn't have to frequent the Rivoli's miserable bar and put up with their miserable staff. Moreover, the bar was advertised as a piano bar but during our stay (February 2005) there was no piano player and a large notice on the piano warning guests not to play the instrument. Like they were afraid we might actually enjoy ourselves! This was a pity since one of our party is a competent piano player and might have cheered the place up a bit.In spite of the above criticisms I would return to this hotel but would want to insist on a good room.

The view from the balcony wasnt the best but it was neat to leave the curtains open and look outward but not downward. The tv hutch was broken but that was no biggy. The beds were nice and the couch sofa bed was also nice for use. We ate dinner at the restr. in the lobby and the food was good. Margarita's were also very good. We used the shuttle to take our son to the airport and then the shuttle came back to pick my husband and I up and back to the hotel, which meant no parking hassles at the airport or anything. That was nice as it was July 4th weekend and the airport was a complete mess and packed. The front desk service was wonderful as well as the restr. and the shuttle driver.

But at $62, we couldn't complain. It isn't really that close to the airport, but there is a shuttle available. Also, if you don't have ground transportation, you may have to take a cab to a restaurant - the hotel is in an office park area; a Waffle House is the only restaurant I saw within walking distance.",1.0,,-1.0,,

(I did not think the hotel food was any good) The pool is very small with only a few lounge chairs so it got crowded quick and with people being so close, it wasn't very relaxing. The hotel itself is very clean and the staff was nice. The pillowtop mattress was very comfortable. The elevators broke down while I was there and then when I took the stairs the stairwell on the 1st floor was locked which was a little upsetting.

Even the swimming pool was off limits and we were told to go across the street and use another hotel's pool. That was bad news. They were not very busy, yet our room overlooked a busy through street facing West and eight hours of bright, hot sunshine. The room was over-priced and very depressing in decorating aspects. The restaurant's food was ok but extremely over-priced. Every time you asked a question of the staff, they would say they didn't know because they had only been there a week or two weeks. They did tell us to go down the street to the Waffle House which had better and less expensive food. Not a very impressive three day stay.",-1.0,-1.0,,,-1.0

There was even new furniture out by the pool (which my kids enjoyed since it was much to cold to swim where we are from). The new expanded fitness center with all new equipment was a plus for my husband, and I was happy just to have a quite breakfast in my room. Food was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating.

The pool was small, but served its purpose of cooling us off and giving us time to relax. The Spa is out of this world. Our 60 min. couples massage was great, expensive but fabulous. T.

We attended a special James Beard gourmet dining experience that was as elegant as any NY restaurant. Our tablemates couldn't have been more charming, gracious and fun.  Our room was ample, offered a 2 person soaking tub, soft bed and plenty of air conditioning. Our biggest complaint was the hot weather, which wasn't the fault of the hotel.

The resort is perfect for a romantic getaway (next time we are going with our husbands, and trust me, there will be a next time!), but if you go with a friend you'll feel right at home too.

It is like having your own little villa with a small patio overlooking the lime trees and Camelback mountain. We never head another person walk by our room or any other noises during the day.

Had a shock at check-in when they told me of the $22 a night service charge but it was worth every cent, due to the excellent friendly staff at the resort (special mention to the pool staff and the car valets), who earned it and more. Very few negatives and lots of positives. The pool area is not the largest and would be pushed to serve everyones needs when the hotel is full. However when it is quiet, as when we were there, then it is ideal. Staff keep you supplied with constant iced water (free of charge), food if required and move the parasols when required, so you do not over do the sunbathing (unless you realy do want to fry). Rooms comforable and there is a turn down service supplied at night. The attention to detail is excellent.

I was there with my husband, my parents, and my sister on a family vacation, but the resort was predominantly couples. The few families that came to the intimate pool left quickly when they saw that the atmosphere was quiet and not conducive to loud children. The service was absolutely unbelievable at every turn (Rick at the pool takes service to another level...) and, in the one case it wasn't (the spa did not have our appointments in its system), the extremely apologetic staff bent over backwards to accommodate us.

Lucky for us, our friends recommended this resort and it turned out to be one of those where have you been all my life? experiences. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, was PERFECT. We can't wait for a reason to get back up there, unbearable Phoenix heat and all (we live in Tucson and everyone knows it is always at least 10 degrees hotter in Phoenix than Tucson and even when it's over 100, it MATTERS). **Bonus Tip: for a lovely, intimate, absolutely five star meal, go to Christopher's at the Biltmore Plaza.

The indoor relaxation areas are very small, and only two showers, which seems a little odd.Only quibble with the room: poor lighting in the bathroom makes it hard for us middle-aged women to put on make-up!",1.0,1.0,,,1.0

Service is top notch, the food is excellent and the rooms of course are beautiful with a great view. Nice quality mattresses, linens, and amenities. The service is comparable to the Beverly Hills Hotel. An example is: we asked about a restaurant and they brought reviews to us; and when we decided to dine there, they made reservations and printed a map. Everything was waiting in an envelope when we went to get our car for the evening. We are treated so well, weather we are in a smaller summer discount room or a suite in March for spring training. The employees of The Royal Palms Inn will go out of there way to assist you to the best of their ability, we did not hear?with out a very valid reason; and they came up with alternatives.

The hotel does offer a tram service, but the walk was quite easy and enjoyable. This hotel was also a great location for a visit to The American Girl Place in The Grove. It took us a short 20 minute drive to reach The Grove. We all enjoyed our stay at The Hilton Universal City, and would definitely stay here again!",1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0

199,"Great Stay  This is a great place to stay even if you're not visiting Universal Studios (I was attending the final of American Idol) this is a large convention type hotel but the service is personalized and down to earth. My room was HUGE with a marble accented bathroom and a bed that I would iked to have taken home with me. I didn't eat at any of the restaurants but did take advantage of the Executive Level lounge with offers evening hors d'oeuvres and continetal breakfast. The appetizers were basic but tasty and filling the breakfast was a littleon the skimpy side. Just bagels, cereal, fruit and coffee/juice.If your're in between visits to Universal Studios or a meeting then relaxing at the pooll is a treat. Overall the service, accomodations and value is worth a vist.",1.0,1.0,,,1.0
200,"nice place, great location! We stayed at the Hilton during our visit to Universal Studios. The location was close enough that you could walk to the park , if you don't mind walking uphill and then up some stairs(good exercise though!). The lobby was very upscale and the staff at check in were very friendly and helpful. The staff allowed us to check in 8 hours early on a Saturday.  The room was pretty large along with the bathroom. It would've been better if the mirror and sink were outside the bathroom to prevent fogging up but, no big deal. The room also had a huge window that made for a great view of the park. The biggest problem with the room was that it smelled of cigarettes and had a burn in the blanket. Other than the aformentioned problems, the stay was great.",1.0,1.0,-1.0,1.0,1.0
201,"Nice Hotel We stayed at this hotel May 6-8. We booked the two doubles in the executive area. The executive room gives you complimentary breakfast and hours douerves in the lounge.Pros:Comfy beds!!! Love the sheets and comforters and pillows. The bedding was wonderful! Housekeeping kept our room very clean. The lady even knocked on our door after we got back to ensure everything was okay. Room service was great. Friendly service. Yes it took awhile, but we could hear the phones ringing off the hook when we called.Comp breakfast in lounge had a good selection. Bagels, pastries, fruit and cereal.Elegant looking hotel from the lobby to the room and on to the parking. Spotless.Cons:Parking for registration, if you are not valeting, is a bit confusing. Valet just held our car for us by the front and then we self parked.Dining was strange. Buffet only in one restaurant on certain nights and the lounge area downstairs was not really a full meal. More like expensive finger foods. It is within walking distance of Universal Studios, but you have to walk partway on the street. It is marked with a little walkway though, but we had to ask for directions before leaving the hotel as it isn't marked until you are halfway to the park. Comp evening hour douerves were few. Potato skins and empanadas. A fruit tray and some cheese completed it.I would stay here again. It was a bit formal for my taste, but the service and cleanliness were great!",1.0,,1.0,,1.0
202,"Second Time Here - Still Great! Stayed here March 18-25 with my mother. We had stayed here last year and loved it and since we needed to be in the LA area again we decided to stay here again.This year I booked on line for a room on the executive level... Although my pre-paid reservation was for a room on the executive level they didn't have any available when we got there so we were in a room on another floor. (We were assured the rooms were actually the same.) We were given the key to access the executive lounge however, until I advised the front desk two days into our stay, we were not receiving the turn down service or the daily newspaper we would have received if we had actually been on the executive level which is what my reservation was for.The executive lounge had a nice continental breakfast - cereal, fruit, yogurt, pastries.... The breakfast buffet on the first floor was great too if you wanted things such as eggs, bacon, waffles and the like for breakfast. The buffet also had a wide selection of Asian foods as well as other pastries, fruits, cereals and yogurt.In the evening the lounge had appetizers.Most evenings we had dinner at the City Walk. They have a great selection there and a shuttle will take you to and from the hotel for free. Our 16th floor room was nice (although the wallpaper did show a bit of wear) and we had a great view of the 101 Freeway, the surrounding hills and Universal Studios.All in all we had an excellent stay and despite the fact that we weren't actually on the executive level like I had paid for, we had a good time. We will definitely stay here again when we return to LA.",,1.0,,,1.0
203,"Great Location to Universal and Hollywood Good hotel at a great location. The staff was very helpful. The only negative i found was the $14 per day parking fee, but I guess that is OK for L.A.I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.",,1.0,,,1.0
204,"Accessible to mass transport, if you'd rather not drive I stayed at the Hilton/Universal City for business reasons. It was a nice hotel, though somewhat dated. I had a room on the 10th floor with a nice view of the mountains and the freeway (with the famous LA traffic). The City Walk was quite accessible via a shuttle or by walking over. To get to the Hollywood landmarks one usually drives, but the Metro can easily get you there. There is a station just down the hill; you can walk down and cross the street. Walking back from the station is more of a challenge because of the somewhat steep incline but we learned another way: take the Universal Studios shuttle (which stops at a covered area at the bottom of the hill) to the ticket area then walk a liitle to get to the shuttle stop for the hotel, or walk over to the hotel. The concierge was able to provide a Metro Map but we had to find out about the getting back to the hotel bit on our own. The drive to the airport can be quite a long one, so make sure you have a lot of time. Overall the stay was pleasant, but not extraordinary.",,1.0,,,
205,"Perfect Location...Very Helpful Staff! We spent a week at the Hilton Universal in January. We used it as our home base for a week spent touring Southern California. The location was excellent...minutes from downtown, walking distance from City Walk/Universal Studios, and about 2 and a half hours from San Diego - where we spent a lovely day at the Zoo and then drove back to the Hilton Universal the same day. The Hotel is 10 minutes from horseback riding under the Holywood sign...the highlight of out trip. Check in was a breeze. When I went to self park the car (my choice - valet also available) my wife called from the room to tell me we had inadvertantly left a suitcase at the airport. We were staying on the Executive level and I wasted no time availing myself of the concierge services in the Executive lounge. Ma'ayan, the concierge, melted away my angst instantly. She got on the phone and spoke to her contact at American Airlines. They confirmed that they had the bag and she arranged a messenger service to deliver the bag to the hotel for a nominal fee. All this while I was relaxing in the lounge eating a danish and coffee!....Although a bit cold for the pool in January, my daughters enjoyed a late night dip in the outdoor hottub (open until midnight) after a tough day of sightseeing. There are plenty of restaurants available for dinner at CityWalk, a short walk away. Meals in the hotel were pricey for a family, but were beautifully presented and plentiful.After overeating in the Executive lounge (included in the room fee) I made good use of the on site gym. The upgrade to the executive level is well worth the fee, especially if you are traveling with kids. Mine particularly enjoyed the free daily breakfast.During your stay, I recommend visiting the 3rd street promanade in Santa Monica, Venice Beach, and taking a drive though Malibu Canyon. You can avoid Disneyland, the NBC studios tour, and the Santa Monica Pier.Enjoy!",,1.0,,1.0,1.0
206,"Best room ever... feels like honeymoon I was in LA for holiday and was very impressed by this hotel. I was at another 2 star hotel near hollywood walk of fame cos I heard its more central. But the condition of that hotel was so horrible that I checked out after just 1 nite and moved to Hilton. It was my best decision during the trip. We got the 14th floor overlooking universal studio. Room has a great view with the best bed and bathroom. Best of all, we got the room at just slightly over $130 per nite. It is only marginally more expensive than the 2 star hotel we stayed the nite before at Hollywood. We drove, so the location was not a problem at all. Universal Studio is only 5mins walk away, or if you prefer you could catch the free shuttle provided at the hotel. Definitely recommend this hotel to all holiday and business goers - esp those who has own transport.",1.0,1.0,,1.0,
207,"Great Hotel  We booked this hotel through the Hilton web pages and got a great deal for our stay in mid October, we requested a non smoking room above the 16th floor and got what we wanted on the 18th and on a corner of the building, views over the valley towards the mountains. I must admit that in some of the floors, the corridors and areas look very tired, but having noted the the reviews by others in regard to the ongoing renovation, get a room as high as you can. The rest of the hotel appeared as to the standard expected, got pastries and coffee for a few bucks just before pick up for our tour 09:00, fast efficent restaurant staff.Eat at the Universal City or locally, lots of Diners etc. Excellent location for the freeway and a 5 minute ride on the shuttle bus to Universal City Plaza.

This Hilton has also always had a nice fruit  light snack platter waiting for us when we arrive (that may be because I am in Hilton HHonors program - I'm not sure).

The beds were super comfortable. The bathroom was quite large. The pool was great but not good for little ones. It gets deep very fast, our youngest happily hung out on the very long steps.

It took three trips to the front desk to get the billing right (after being assured it was fixed). I stood around for 20 minutes waiting for the bellhop to get my bag out of the back room. They gave me a smoking room saying that was all they had -- and then gave me a non-smoking when I balked. There was an overall crappy attitude by the front desk -- something I would expect from a Motel 6 in Compton. I stayed at the Beverly Hilton a few weeks ago and it was 180 degrees opposite.

I felt like I was going to get robbed at any moment just walking from the curb to the front door.My second issue was with the room itself. Once I got there, I couldn't believe that I had paid $125. It wasn't worth half that. I stopped counting at the third hair I found in the bathroom. There were popcorn kernels on the nightstand. The lamp by the nightstand was burnt out. There were strange burn marks all over the carpet. The mini-fridge, although a nice ammenity in concept, was so grimy and moldy on the inside that I definitely wouldn't have used it.

Being familiar with the chain this seemed to be a reasonable choice and we were after all just spending the night and then moving on the following day.The location of the building is nearly UNDER the freeway overpass and very close to the airport so you are bombarded by noise from both places.

Now I'm not at all a fussy traveller but I draw the line at freshly spilled blood on the bed linens. I called the front desk and asked if we could be moved to another room and was offered a courtyard suite. This room was on the ground level and somewhat less noisy. My friend opened the door of the room to let in some air. When I stuck my head outside I noticed a couple of very unsavoury characters hanging out in the back alley which bordered the hotel. I then locked and bolted the door and went to sleep thinking we had a 50/50 chance of being robbed before morning.Free shuttle to airport was good and on time, and the full breakfast very good.

The lamp between the beds had two light sockets with one socket broken apart with wires showing. Mismatched tile repair in the shower, badly cracked ceiling in the bathroom with peeling paint. Bed was lumpy and you could feel the springs underneath the thin layer of padding over them.For a $60/night, I might have tolerated some of these problems, but not at the $150/night that I was charged.Restaurant was even a worse experience. On Sunday, only offered a buffet. Entree choices were beef in heavy gravy and grease soaked fried chicken with lots of untrimmed fat. By the time my wife got to the hot table, there was only fried chicken left. Salad bar had a large bowl of lettuce with lots of old wilted lettuce left in the bowl.

Upon return from our week away our car was damaged by someone evidently backing into it. The spaces are very small and distance between rows is adequate for careful drivers, but evidently not the one who hit us and then failed to notify. I went to the desk and advised Raj who was working the desk. He said he would write a report and have it ready to send to the company in the morning. There was another person on the desk in the A.M. and he said he didn't know of any report being written.I would advise against leaving a vehicle there if you want it in the same condition you left it in. The rooms are OK but the clientele is a little dicey. I would say the rooms were clean but the building is clearly showing its age.

Unless it's changed radically....On the downside, don't arrive here late, as there's no after-hours restaurant. And the place isn't the cleanest in the world. The pool wasn't clean.On the plus side: there's a cheap takeout fast food place next door, there's a 7 ELEVEN type store near-by and there's an independent bar next door (Beware though, it's a bit tough).You can walk to the airport terminals in 5-10 minutes.It's passable for an overnight but don't plan a vacation here.

834,"Roadside Redeye I booked this hotel because it is close to the airport and it was to be a nice place to rest for an overnight stay. Was I wrong! The dominant feature of this facility was the inescapable noise from the highway. The hotel is directly under the overpass of the major highway and the traffic never stops. It appears to be a once-nice accommodation, with a pool and a restaurant. The restaurant closes early in the evening, leaving the later arrivals to wander a questionable neighborhood in search of food. The breakfast there is good. The staff is friendly. The beds are adequate. Carpets are stained and dirty. Cleanliness of rooms is below average. There is a shuttle service to and from the airport. The service to the airport is fine. Not so the arrival: We sat for at least half an hour awaiting the shuttle from the airport, watching other shuttles from area hotels come and go. That was another unwelcome frustration. If you are looking for a restful night, this is not the place for you. I will never return. The inconvenience of traveling further from the airport to rest my weary body is minor when compared to the overwhelming discomfort of the roadside redeye experienced at this hotel.

The staff seemed to be very helpful.The worst part is its location right next to the interstate. The noise is very disturbing. The overall condition of the property was also poor.

847,"Loud Street Noise, No AC We were looking for a hotel in the Union Square area that we could easily reach by BART as we were flying out from the international terminal the next day. This hotel is very close to a BART station. After having had a bad experience at the Palace (very loud street noise, couldn't sleep), I looked for a Union Square hotel review that did not mention street noise. However, the street noise at the Stratford did turn out to be very loud. There was a band playing across the street until 11PM or so. There was no AC in the room and it does sometimes get hot in SF. So you have to open the window to cool down. The windows only open about 4 inches so it is very tough to cool down. The room was very small, but that is to be expected in SF. It was a remodel of a very old building and the age showed through in some places. There was a flat screen TV to make it look more modern, but it was a tiny one. Because of the low price, I did not feel as bad as I did after staying at the Palace. But I'd only recommend this hotel for night owls for nights when cold weather is predicted, or for college kids planning to stay out late, get drunk then pass out. If I stay in that area again, I'd probably stay at the Hilton two blocks away. I avoided that hotel because it was closer to the Tenderloin but there isn't much difference in two blocks, and there are panhandlers between the BART station and this hotel anyway.",,-1.0,,,

We arrived early and were greeted by a very friendly and accomodating staff. Our bags were stowed until check in time and we headed out. Bus and MUNI are also only a few minute walk away and the trolley runs directly in front of the hotel. Had lunch and returned to hotel. Rooms are very small but comfortable and clean. Similar to accomodations throughout Europe. Walls however are a bit thin and can hear walking over head. We are not light sleepers so this was no problem for us.

850,"All I needed The other reviews have it right. The rooms are small and most have only one bed. Make sure you book a family suite if traveling with more than one other CLOSE friend. Most rooms have only a shower, no bathtub, which is fine with me, because I only take showers. My room was immaculate, and stayed that way throughout my stay. Furnishings are simple but the bed was comfortable and everything was in good condition. Only had one trouble - there was a circuit breaker for the bathroom and light over the sink that tended to trip. The front desk clerk told me how to reset it.Desk staff was friendly and helpful and checking in and out was fast and easy. There is an included continental breakfast in a nice tea room on the second floor, but it is minimal. There is bread and toasters, granola and yogurt. There is a nice selection of muffins. They have coffee, tea, milk and two types of fruit juice. I wish they had had fresh fruit. The room filled up fast when they opened at 7:30, but there was more seating by the time I left at a little after 8. If you want an American style breakfast, several restaurants in the area have it.Location was great, two blocks from the Powell St. transit stations, which meant that I got there from SFO on BART in less than 45 minutes for only $5.35.

The hotel is just up the street a few minutes walk from the start of the cable car route to Fishermans Wharf and Union Square is about half a minute walk around the corner. We got BART from the airport ($5.35pp) and walked up Powell Street to the hotel. The young man at reception was most helpful and showed us on maps where the hotel was and pointed out areas to visit. He also said that if we wanted to know anything to come back and ask.The room we had was small as we expected but very clean with a reasonably comfortable bed, a sink in the room and a separate small room with shower and toilet. There was a hairdryer beside the sink and an iron/ironing board in the small wardrobe. Towels were replaced daily. After hiking around all day we didn't notice any noise at night!Continental breakfast was included in the room rate which is unusual for US. This was orange or cranberry juice, yogurt, cereal, toast, muffins and hot drinks and was adequate to keep us going until lunchtime.There were plenty of places to eat around the hotel - we had great Thai food just around the corner in Muang Thai and enjoyed Lori's Diner too. We also had dinner in Jazz Bistro Les Joulins which was lovely and very reasonable with the added extra of live music.The shopping around this area was great too - every type of shop from Gucci and Louis Vuitton to Ross and Marshalls!We would stay here again due to cleanliness, value for money and location, but don't go if you want 5 star luxury and plan to spend lots of time in your room.",,1.0,1.0,,

Perfect for any tourist wanting to be close to all the action and be able to get around town easily. We were able to catch the BART (subway) straight from SFO to Powell station and walk easily with our suitcases to the hotel. In addition, the cable car turnaround on literally 100m away - so it was easily to get to all those tourist attractions (i.e. Fishermans Wharf, Lombard st etc)Although we were initially surprised by the tiny room...we soon made ourselves comfortable. As mentioned by other reviewes..there isnt much floor space for your suitcases however the bedroom and beds were clean - which is important when you just want a place to sleep in at the end of an exhausting day.The complimentary breakfast was a plus. Definitely saved times in the morning wondering around deciding where to eat (and whether anything had opened yet). Although it was quite simple...it was enough to get your day started with toast, muffins, coffee and juice.The only hotel improvements I would recommend are:1) Improve the lift service (it was excruciatingly slow)2) Install air conditioners in the rooms (although our room was quite cool and we never thought twice about needing it)3) Have the sink inside the bathroom as opposed to next to the bed4) Consider having a clearer shower curtain so that you can have some light whilst showering (there were no windows in our bathroom and the only light was in the center of the room)All in all...happy with our stay!",,1.0,,,

The continental breakfast was good for those who are not big breakfast eaters, and there is a Starbuck's across the street from the hotel if you need Starbucks. The hotel is within easy walking distance to Union Square as well as Market Street and the transportation kiosk where you can purchase a 3-day cable car/street car/muni bus pass for $18 - this is a great value as you can take the cable and street cars just about anywhere you want to go. There are a number of very interesting restaurants, shops and jazz clubs in the area, again all within a pleasant walking distance.

And when you step out the hotel you are in the heart of the city, two steps from Union Square. The cable car runs outside the hotel and at the bottom of the street you can get the bus.

The location is very good, if a little claustrophobic, being right on Powell Street at Union Square.The Queen-bed room I stayed in was pretty small but I can cope with that.My main gripe was that there is no individually controlled heating or aircon in the room. While the heating is on, the room is fine, but *they switch the heating off* at about 8.30pm every evening! So it got very cold after that. I don't know when the heating comes on again but it certainly wasn't before 9.30am when I left the hotel each morning.Breakfast is included in the price and was OK: muffins, pastries, toast, cereal and the like; but not much choice and it was exactly the same every day, so you may get bored of it quite quickly.",-1.0,1.0,,,

We found that our hotel is located just half a block from Union Square and just 2 blocks from where the cable car turns around.

We paid $10 more for the king. We told the front desk but didn't even acknowledge it. I have since gone on the Orbitz site and they have removed the king room. The bed took up the whole room. The bathroom was very small but extremely clean. Our room was right next to the stairway and it just happened that there was some kind of run/walk going on the next day. The walls are paper thin and the runners were on the stairs at 5:00am. Our room looked out at a brick wall. No air but didn't need it. We learned real quick that San Francisco is not very warm, my husband ended up buying a winter jacket! There was a couple checking out the day after we checked in. They did not have a working toilet for the 2 days that they were there. There were no other rooms available and the hotel offered them $20 off a night.

901,"About as central as you can get The Stratford is a good but unprepossessing budget hotel right on Powell Street less than a block from Union Square. The basic rooms are small but clean and well furnished. I've stayed there twice, first in 311 a small room at the back of the hotel. It was small but very quiet and perfectly adequate. This time we had room 601, one of their deluxe Centennial Club Rooms. This was a much larger, better furnished room overlooking Powell... it was noisy at night, and again in the morning when recycled garbage was collected around 4am and then a little later when the cable cars started. We had no problem sleeping and the noise of the city gave it an atmosphere, but if you are a light sleeper don't get one in the front.

We didn't have much of a view, but that didn't really matter to us. The room was small, I won't lie on that point, but we didn't go to San Francisco to spend the whole time in our room. The room was clean and the furnishings were nice. It looked like it had been recently remodeled, the paint was nice and clean looking. Our bed was very comfy and my husband and I slept like a dream, even though neither of us sleep well in hotel rooms. I love how close this place is to all the fun things to do on Market Street. We were right across the street from all sorts of restraunts on Powell and were just a short walk from the Westfield mall and all the shops around there. It was also very easy to get around to the other places in the city as well. We were close enough to walk all the way to Chinatown and back. The Stratford is right on the cable car line, and you can catch it right outside the hotel's door. It's also very close to the underground train and the bus line. It wasn't noisy at all, like other guests have mentioned, but, we were at the back of the property. We left both windows open all night both nights and didn't have a problem at all, and I'm an incredibly light sleeper. The elevator did seem to move a little slow sometimes, but it's an old building so I didn't expect it to go rocket fast! Plus, I wasn't really in any sort of a hurry. The staff was incredibly helpful when we asked about buying MUNI passes and places to eat and thrift shops to go to in the area! It was nice to have someone to valet park our car too, then we didn't have to worry about it for two days!",1.0,,1.0,,1.0

The room was small but not to the extent that the door opens into the bed. We found it charming and decently clean. We requested a room facing the street because it would be boring to stay at the back. It was noisy the first night but we quickly got used to the city buzz and slept like babies for the following nights. We didn't find the elevator *that* slow but then we don't understand what was the hurry. Location-wise, it is definitely convenient. Cable car is only steps from the front door and a short walk from the Powell station.Breakfast consists of sliced bread, muffins, granola, yogurt, jam, juice, coffee and hot water. Far from ideal for a vegan like me. But it's a minor irritant. My mom who is a vegetarian, enjoyed the muffins and granola with yogurt.The interesting part was -- someone set off the fire alarm early in the morning one day (before day break) and the fire alarm sent us running up and down the stairs some 3 times before the issue was resolved. We were up anyway and found the unintended morning exercise amusing. But some elderly in wheelchair was stressed, trapped on the 6th floor without a working elevator. Not at all the hotel's fault.

Just off Union Square - great shopping, if that's your thing.The cable car allows direct access to Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf. Tip: to get a multiday pass for the cable car and buses (a big moneysaver), go to the Visitors Ctr., don't wait in the line at the nearby cable car station. We arrived from the airport by BART ($5), no hassle, and an easy walk even with luggage. The hotel itself reminded me of the kind of little place you will find in a European city. Staff was friendly enough. The room was tiny but cozy, clean, shower large with good pressure. The breakfast is VERY basic, but with SF prices, might as well wolf down those muffins to fill up! Coffee and orange juice were both decent. Would definitely stay here again.Some tips: 1. Don't hesitate to use BART to get to this hotel, it's close. 2. Union Square has a booth selling half price theater ticket. We went to 2 shows within easy walking distance, and they were great. 3.

We were given a room on the 7th floor, it faced away from the street which i assume is a distinct advantadge as it can get quite noisy with trams etc. Room was small but the bathroom was large but for the money who cares, we went there to visit the city not sit in our room. Everthing seemed very clean as well. Staff were helpful. Breakfast is limited to toast and muffins with plenty of choice with drinks though. Again for the money who can complain, just so long as we had something to keep us going. We walked around a lot, San Francisco has a lot of distinct neighborhoods (and hills!) so be prepared. People were great, very helpful and laid back.

Room was very clean and bright - no a/c but not needed. Room was perpendicular to Powell and very quite.Serve a continetal breakfast on 2nd floor which looked fine - we ate at Lefty O'Doul's again! Liked Lefty's.Absolutely would stay at the Stratford again - paid about $ 120+ for Sir Francis on line and less than $ 60 on line at the StratfordLocation was great - if we return we will stay on Powell and not off Powell - not sure I would want to be more than 2-3 blocks either side of Powell.,,,1.0,,

The complimentary breakfast is barely adequate (toast and packaged muffins), but the breakfast room was nice with big windows on Powell Street.

This is the place if you are budget conscious and just want a clean, quiet place to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. It's superbly located in the heart of Union Square district, steps away from shopping, theaters, countless restaurants and bars, and public transportation (buses, BART). We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. A simple breakfast of toast/muffins, juice, and coffee is offered in a small dining room - it's all we needed.Yes, there is no air-con, but none was needed, even during the warm month of July, since the temperature cools down drastically at night. The only minor irritation was the slo-o-ow elevator that carries only 5 people at one time. But the pluses far outweigh the minuses.

I don't know what floor the smelly carpet people were staying in, but we had a fine room. We got a queen bed with private bath in room 606. I could tell the room and carpets had been newly redecorated. It was a painted a cheery yellow, modern, simple furniture, a botanical print on the wall and ... (you can tell I'm a gal) tasteful, box-pleated dust-ruffles that I'd put in my own home. Anyone who pays that much attention to details in a budget hotel scores points with me. The bonus, for those of you who need to sleep during the day, are room-darkening curtains. Staff was nice and accomodating. The clientele, as is often the case on New Year's Eve, was young, so there was noise in the hallways that night. Other than that, I'd recommend it to my budget-conscious friends.

It's clean, no frills, and comfortable, yet pretty close to being run down and outdated (looks like it was built in the 60s or early 70s and was was remodeled in the early 90s). Pros: central location, affordable (we booked a package on Travelocity and the hotel was essentially free, but I wouldn't pay more than $50 a night) quiet, and staff was friendly and helpful. We asked the front desk if they could store our laptops for the day while we went sight-seeing (no safe in the room) which they did and were very accommodating. At the same time, the decor and fixtures are pretty dated and, as others have said, no frills. There is also a charge for internet and parking. (A parking fee I can understand--it's San Francisco, but not offering free internet is usually a deal-breaker for me). All in all I don't feel ripped off but I wouldn't stay here again.

Cost is $15 plus the hostess adds in an automatic 15% tip on the bill (we had a party of 4, not a large group). We didn't realize this as we didn't get the bill until we went up to the front to pay, and already had left her a tip at the table.

The suite had two bathrooms in it which was a nice surprise and they looked like they had been remodeled recently. The seating area had a pull out double bed, which was really comfortable for my guests. The room had a very elegant feel to it, with wrap around windows to create an amazing view of the city. The hotel staff was very accommodating. I went down and asked for two more blankets and they brought them back up to the room for me. In the morning I asked if we could have a later check out and they gave us two more hours, without chargeThe lobby of the hotel was really nice and check in and out was a breeze. Parking is extra but only $20 which is amazing for this city. The location of the hotel is really nice also. It is walking distance to Union Square, a $7 cab ride to the Marina. My only complaint is that the walls are thin and you can hear people in other rooms but that is typical of a lot of hotels and something that you just deal with when staying in a hotel.

The night hotel staff was personable and friendly, even when I had to come back to the check in desk, as my electronic room key did not work (quite a trek hauling luggage and waiting for the elevator to come up to the eighth floor). The elevators were extremely slow and out of the three, I only saw two that were actually running the time that I was there. The room was very, very small (two doubles), and in a state of disrepair feeling and scared wallpaper, peeling paint and mildew on the bathroom ceiling and poor lighting period (bath  room). Lots of noise from the hallway and street, even on the eighth floor. The beds were hard and the pillows were hard and flat; I did not sleep well at all. The conference rooms were also in disrepair, but the catered food was good. For the price that I paid ($129.00/night) plus parking, I do not feel that our large conference group got our moneye worth.

The room was not beautifully decorated or freshly painted, but it was clean, big, and had computer access, showtime and a very clean bathroom. We needed help with the heater, a maintenance person was there within minutes to help. Service was excellent and staff was friendly. Basically if you are looking for a nice place to stay for a reasonable rate, this is a nice and clean place stay. The room smelled a little of smoke, but they have asked that no one smoke in the rooms, either they are still trying to get the smell out from past smoking rooms or people smoke in the room anyway.

Management was extremely accommodating about changing our room and even let us check out the new room to be sure it was quiet. The lobby and restaurant areas are very nice, but the rest of the hotel is showing its age, though everything was clean. The floor indicator lights in the elevators didn't work. The first room we were given was in desparate need of at least a new coat of paint to cover all of the scuff marks. The second room looked as though it had been painted more recently, but both rooms had stained carpet, old-looking electrical outlets, and outdated tile and fixtures. The rooms also do not come standard with refrigerators. Rooms with refrigerators are available at an extra charge.While priced about $100 less than the Holiday Inn down the street, the Cathedral Hill was still below expectations for its $124 per night price tag.

We started our holiday in San Francisco and stayed at the Cathedral Hotel located on Van Ness Ave. We found the best deal for San Francisco hotels on LastMinute.com.au. The hotel was clean and comfortable, the staff courteous and friendly. The noise however from busy Van Ness Ave was incessant and intrusive, so if you need something a little more quieter, then you should consider somewhere else or a room towards the back of the property. We were offered such a room on checkin for an extra US$50 a night, which we declined.The Cathedral Hotel is reasonably located, especially if you want to be near Union Square. It was an easy bus ride (or cable car if you wish to walk the 6-7 blocks) down to the Pier 39 and Fishermans wharf area.The hotel has a pool and a fitness area, but there is so much to do and see in San Francisco that we didnt have time to make use of these facilities and we got plenty of exercise walking around. One lesson that we learnt booking our accommodation on the internet and not knowing our way around American airports, is to enquire about shuttle services from the airport to the hotel, before you travel. We made this mistake and consequently spent a lot on taxis, on arriving at each destination. Once at the hotel we were able to organise a shuttle back, a much cheaper option.",,,1.0,,1.0

The carpets were stained and the beds felt like you were sleeping on plywood. We needed a roll away cot for our daughter and some of the springs were starting to stick through. The beds have those old fashioned bedspreads, the ones that NEVER get washed. Overall not a great choice. I'll stick to Holiday Inn.",-1.0,,-1.0,,
982,"Average Average hotel stay, room was clean although the decor is a bit tired. Three night stay and the rate was fairly reasonable compared to other SF hotels. Depends on what you are looking for in a hotel, it's okay if you're just using it as a base but we would probably stay somewhere else if we ever went back to SF. Worst points are the lifts (elevators) - rubbish and really slow and wi-fi is not included in rate.The location was ok, we didn't mind walking but there are plenty taxis sitting outside of the hotel.The concierge service was helpful for booking tours.One tip if you do use this hotel: the shuttle service to the airport was really good, the concierge service organised it for us $26 dollars for two which was reasonable and quick,",1.0,1.0,1.0,,

984,"Clean and serviceable hotel Nice stay in a clean hotel, conveniently located for daily activities. Close to most usual attractions (walking distance) with good parking availability. We took the parking included rate (120 $/night) with multiple ins and outs. The only annoynace was that the garage closes hotel's internal access (to elevators) at 11 p.m. so you've to exit and walk 50 yards through the street.We had no difficulties but if you plan to stay out late, avoid walking around because suspicious faces show around.This hotel is a good value option if you plan to enjoy the city during the day.Be aware that there are a lot of notices about asbestos used as construction materials in the property.Another pitiful detail: the TV set works well but the channel availability is very poor. A lot of marketing channels but, for example, Weather Channel is blocked all day.",,,1.0,,
985,"Decent, Affordable Hotel Hotel was decent and very affordable. Ours was relatively clean (except our balcony, which could have been cleaner). Nothing fancy, but then, we weren't in SF for the hotel. Get a room that faces the pool. Very sunny and nice balcony. Right along major bus routes and within a mile of nice restaurants. For the price, this hotel was decent.",,,1.0,,
986,"Not bad at all. Stayed here for three nights on an extension to a mid west tour.Check in was done for us so no dealings with the desk. Our room was ok except for traffic noise, (I noticed the windows were single glazed so no wonder), the beds were fairly comfortable and I didn't notice any peeling wallpaper or carpet stains as others have mentioned.Breakfast was the usual buffet and no complaints. The windows there were double glazed so no traffic noise.The location we thought was not that good, ok you can get a bus outside but I would have prefered a hotel nearer Union Square or the Wharf. Getting around was easy though and we walked to the Wharf and Union Suare a few times although not at night.Tried Mel's opposite for a meal but was not impressed, food was only warm(as most food on this tour was)and the tip was included.It wasn't warm enough for us and didn't have the time to try out the pool.We probably won't come this way again but if we did we would stay at a more central hotel although we found this one not bad at all.",1.0,,,1.0,
987,Pleasant stay at the Cathedral My friend and I had a most enjoyable experience staying at the Cathedral Hill Hotel. The location was such that we could maneuver the streets of San Francisco and yet find our way back to our room. That's very important if you've ever tried to drive in downtown San Francisco!The hotel room was immaculate and it was very quiet. Our room over-looked the courtyard. The hotel staff was always very friendly and helpful.The parking garage was a little crazy but I got the feeling that would be true for any of the parking garages. We were able to find spaces that were near the elevator going right in to the hotel.And another plus to this hotel - the parking fee was for in  out parking. Evidently some places charge for parking each time you leave and for each time you returnWe would definately stay at this hotel again.,,1.0,,,1.0
988,"OK Hotel in dodgy location Firstly, no problems with hotel. Clean, comfortable, good coffee shop, restaraunt not too bad, a tad pricey but good quality.The main issue is location. It is about 7-8 blocks from Chinatown and Union Square, and the walk back takes you through some of the more seedy parts of the city. Definiately give it a miss during hours of darkness",1.0,,1.0,,1.0
989,Awful This was awful experience from the time I checked in until I left. The man at the front desk was rude and took forever to check us in. I reserved a room with a queen size bed and was charged for a queen size bed yet I received a room with two doubles. The room was aboslutely filthy. The carpet in the hallways and in the room was so dirty and greasy that you could not take off your shoes. The sheets on the bed were very old and torn. The comforter had numerous ciggarette burns in it and felt dirty to touch. The couch also was filthy and greasy. After a long day of travel all I wanted was a place to sleep. My husband and I travel a great deal and we have never stayed in such an awful unclean room. I have never written a review and would not be doing so now but I do not want anyone to have to experience something as horrible as this. I honestly do not know how this hotel is passing health inspections. Please do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else. There are many beautiful hotels in San Francisco.,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0
990,"Good Budget Choice for San Francisco Just spent 4 nights at this hotel with my 26 year old daughter. I chose the property because it was one of the only choices (combining air  hotel) that had a room with 2 double beds as an option for a good price. Front desk staff were very efficient. We arrived in the early morning and they had us in our room by 11:00am. Our room, on the 5th floor, was just fine. A little dated perhaps, but clean with comfortable mattresses and pillows.",1.0,,,1.0,1.0
991,"Overpriced for a run down hotel I stayed there for 3 nights despite the mixed reviews I have read. The location is fine- I wouldn't say great since it's almost a mile walk to Union Square but there are a few bus stops near by since the hotel is located on major streets (Geary and Van Ness.)The hotel is run down and needs a major renovation! The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, stains on the carpet and cigarette burns on the tables, etc... The walls were so thin- I constantly heard the t.v. from next door and the toilet flushing.Other than that, the hotel is fine if you don't mind the decor and noise... just overpriced for what you get.",,1.0,,,
992,"Only if you cannot find somewhere else We stayed at this hotel for in August 2008. This hotel appears to have been built and decorated sometime in the 70's and has never been updated or improved. The staff were helpful and courteous. But, the carpet in our room was dirty and smelled. The linens were worn and all the fixtures were old and worn. It is a place to lay your head down at night only. I would not have wanted to spend time in the room or hotel. Their website makes the hotel look much nicer than it really is.",,,-1.0,,1.0
993,"Nothing good to say about this hotel I spend many nights in hotels, and as such am probably more critical than most, but this hotel is really bad. From check-in to check-out there is nothing to commend it. Check-in itself took over 20 minutes, and then when we got to our room it had not been cleaned from the previous occupants. We spent the whole day away from the hotel, and after a wonderful meal at Scomer's on Fisherman's Wharf, when we got back we decided to end the evening with an Irish coffee. It was 10:45pm and the first thing we were told was to hurry up with our order because they were closing at 11pm. The Irish coffe was bitter, cold, and I'm certain they forgot the liqor. The night was punctuated with noise, and at one point at around 4 am some errant person was shouting profanities right outside our door, leading my wife not being able to sleep for the rest of the night. In the morning, check-out took 30 minutes whilst it seemed all of the front-desk staff were chatting and partying in the back office. A truly awful hotel to be avoided at all costs.",-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0

995,OK Stay at Cathedral Hill I booked at Cathedral Hill because it was centrally located and parking was included in my room price. We had adjoining rooms and both were musty and very old. My room was much smaller than the kids and looked as if something (another bed?)had been removed before we got there. The pool was clean but the patio area lacked lounge chairs and any kind of ambience. The restaurant was decent. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were disappointed with the area of San Francisco that the hotel was in. A lot of homeless and you could not walk the surrounding streets at night. Really unsafe!,-1.0,,1.0,,1.0

1148,"3-Star at Most. Avoid it if You Can! I booked for a one night stay through Hotwire, thinking I would get Hyatt Regency, and was disappointed to see Hilton Finacial District showing up. I knew it is in an old concrete building that used to be Holiday Inn, but what could I do? Hotwire surprised me by zoning it into Embarcadero rather than Union Square East!Anyhow, I checked in on Sat, Dec 1 at 4pm, and was told right away by Monica, a dark-skinned lady at front desk, that she only has rooms with 2 double-beds available, and upgrading to a bay-view room with King-szie bed would cost $50 more. With my wife standing right beside me, I had to take it even though I knew it was a rip-off (I paid only $85 to Hotwire). The room was kind of small, but has a great view facing Coit Tower and the bay. The bed is comfortable as others suggested. But everything else is below my standard of a 4-star hotel. The bath room is really small with a single sink. The tub is small. The recent face-lift was done with poor quality and cheap material. And 25-inch TV?Even worse, it is noisy even at 18th floor. There was some constant noise there even when I turned off my heater/AC. The building has poor sound insulation, so I was waken up real early in the morning first by shower in the next room and then vacume on the floor above.All in all, this is a 2.5 star in my opinion! This is my first time staying in a Hilton in the US, and I will never do it again. And I guess no more Hotwire either.",1.0,,,-1.0,-1.0

1152,"Very, very,very poor service and average hotel... There are really only two positive things I can say about this hotel:* The concierge was polite and helpful;* The rate through Priceline ($100 / 拢50 p.night) was reasonableAm sorry to say that everything else from start to finish of our 3 day stay (and the aftermath) was poor. Specifically:a) Despite three phone calls prior to arrival the Hotel refused to book us a king room (and/or bay view room), saying that we had to ask on arrivalb) On check-in the clerk said there were no king rooms, no bay view rooms and no rooms above the 5th floor. Thanks!c) On arriving at our 'full-size' room we discovered: One of the 'phones did not work, the bath plug did not work, and it was noisy. The 'wireless internet' did not work in the room as the signal was so weak;d) The 'city-view' room had no double glazing (in the 21st century? really?) and so was highly susceiptible to street noise;e) As many have said, the elevators were so slow that queues of literally 10 - 15 people (most of whom appeared to be college students who were the worst for wear) regularly gathered in reception waiting just to get to their rooms;f) On our last night (a Sunday) we needed to get an early night (ie. 10:00pm) prior to a 6:00AM flight the next day. On returning to our room we found that the noise from the karaoke in the conference room TWO FLOORS below was so loud that there was no hope of getting to sleep. After 40 minutes complaining (having tried to ring reception for 15 minutes without success, the phone having been apparently off the hook) and then having to take the emergency stairs because the lifts were so slow, we were told that the noise would stop at 11:30 as security had been notified; My partner stressed to reception that we did not want to return to our room to find that the noise had not abated because it would take so long to contact reception again.Having got back to our room, we discovered the noise was as bad as ever.After a further 20 mins on the phone, we were told the hotel could do nothing about it as the party had permission to continue until midnight. We were told there were no rooms elsewhere in the hotel to which to move.On continuing to compain we were eventually put through to a Mr. Mark Everton (the general manager) who magically discovered a new room on the 11th floor and who offered us the grand sum of $50 in cash incompensation to pay for our taxi to the airport the next morning. By this time it was 12:30 am....g) Unbelievably, on checking out at 6:00am we discovered the Hilton had had the gall to charge the $50 to our room. Having wasted a further 15 mins explaining the situation to the desk clerk he issued us with a credit note but no apology.h) On returning to the UK we discovered the Hilton had charged us the $50 and not honoured the credit note.A FAX to Mr. Everton yielded no results and a follow-up phone call (at our expense!!!!) failed to prompt an apology.To date we are yet to receive the credit.......",-1.0,-1.0,1.0,-1.0,-1.0
1153,"Service counts The hotel looks great on the surface. It's clean (unlike some other reviewers mention), modern, and renovated. But once you settle in you'll fine many little annoyances. To mention few: the bathroom outlet had no power, the toilet flush did not work properly, the coffee maker was broken etc. None are a big deal but for a 4 star, recently renovated hotel, you would expect more. The most important problem with the building itself is that there is no sound proofing. The windows' glass is so thin, it was as if we had left the windows open. We heard every little street sound. And it is a very noisy area. So if you are sensetive to city noise during sleep, don't even consider it there. There was some noise from adjacent rooms, but the street noise overshadowed that anyway. The beds were nice. The shower was great. The rooms was amall. But the main problem we had was the service. We checked in late but were told that the houskeeping was running behind and our room was not ready. In addition, we had requested a king bed and they said there are only rooms with double beds available if any. When asked for upgrades to something which is ready, they said nothing available. After we finally got a room, my wife was diappointed with the view, so she called and asked if we could at least get a bay view out of courtesy since they did not have king bed we had requested. They said since we made our reservation online, we are the lowest priority and will not be able to get anything better than what our current room was. That I found too blunt for customer servie in a 4 start hotel. Just a final note, they had added a $20 dollar room serive on the checkout bill, when I inquire about this (couple times on the phones which they said will look into and call back but never did and finally in person), they said they could not find any receipts for it and waived it.

I called the front desk to have them fix it the next day, they never fixed it! When I called the second day to request another room, I was told the same thing. They did not even offer to upgrade me.

1155,"fantastic location, but it is noisy during the week Arriving on a Saturday, we had a great first two nights sleep here, and wondered why so many reviewers had complained about traffic noise. Well, did we find out on the third night!! The traffic noise on a midweek night/morning is incredible, and we were on the ninth floor! Some double glazing wouldn't go amiss. Deliveries being made, sirens, reversing noises - be warned! Having said that, the location is fabulous, just off union square, so you need to weigh it up I suppose. Also, the room sizes are not huge - we had upgraded to what they called a junior suite but it was pretty much a normal sized room (though it did have a nice sofa) so a normal room might be quite small. Overall, though, we liked this hotel, loads of character and great location(and we didn't think it was run down or shabby at all, as some others have).

When we booked at the last minute he told us we were lucky to get a room with such short notice. Then later I overheard him on the phone telling someone he only had 56 bookings that night. Not a way to make me feel welcome. If you like older hotels I could see how you could maybe see it as sort of charming. The parking was just around the corner.

1157,"Not the Ritz, but a decent place to stay We found the place thru Frommers and it has already been mentioned that this place is not the Ritz. We got a family room. Which is 2 rooms and a bathroom. The front room is facing Lombard, so it is very loud, but our kids sleep like bricks, so they were fine. The back room was alittle quieter, so that worked better for us. If noise is a problem for you, I would not recommend the rooms that are up along Lombard. Ask for the rooms on the back side of the motel. But this worked fine for us and the fridge and microwave were useful.The rooms were both very dated and tiny. There is barely a foot of walking room around the beds. The bathroom is actually spacious in comparison even though very dated.The rooms are kept clean and the maid was always done with the rooms before we came back around lunchtime. There are so many great places to eat on Chestnut street, this was a great location. Alot of sights are within walking distance if you don't mind hiking it. But there are bus stops all over the place and you can get anywhere if you hop on the right bus. It did take a bit to figure out the right bus though, so I suggest you look at the routes online before your trip, or use their free wi-fi when you get to the motel. Or I imagine you can pick up a bus schedule somewhere. Bus 39 on Chestnut went everywhere though: Fisherman's wharf, Little Italy, China Town, Financial district. Or ask for a transfer when you board the bus. Also, the bus drivers were all very friendly if you need help.Overall, the price was nice compared to other places in the area and the free parking would make it a steal if you have a car (we just walked everywhere though).Take advantage of the BOGO breakfast coupon from the lobby. The prices were high, but if you're buying just 2 dishes, then the free one makes up for the overpriced first dish. But be ready, everything in San Fran is expensive, so this is not a bad deal at all. Also, check the times on the coupon before you go. I think Sundays had a time restriction.",-1.0,,1.0,1.0,
1158,"Sleep tight...but be careful in room 28 We are frequent travelers who look for the best value for the money- the Marina Motel seemed to fit all of our requirements- reasonable price, good location, parking included, kitchenette, free wi-fi. With three people in the party we tried to book a room with two double beds, but they were already booked, so we had a double with a rollaway cot- ROOM 28. It was a very small room, but adequate and on the inner courtyard to reduce the noise from Lombard Street. The location is around the corner from Chestnut Street which has good restaurants, a market for groceries, and a stop for the bus to go downtown. All in all we liked it except:After a couple of days, we discovered some strange bugs on the walls and bed-we did an internet search and also took a couple of them to Heidi, the manager, who confirmed that they were indeed bedbugs. She was very proactive and called Terminex immediately, but they could not come until the next day- in the interim the staff vacuumed and cleaned the room thoroughly. Being a summer weekend in San Francisco, with most hotels filled, we did not have many options other than giving them a chance to try to eliminate the problem. However, when we returned to the room after Terminex had been there and steam cleaned, there were still bugs in the room, and the rollaway was too wet to sleep on, either from the steam cleaning or something being spilled on it. The night clerk was less than helpful, seemed to be a surfer dude/space cadet- he did not want to contact Heidi and told us we could bite the bullet and stay, or find another hotel ( not easy at midnite on Saturday). He did make a few calls to hotels, then said he couldn't help us anymore because he had paperwork to do. When he was finally convinced to call Heidi, she was of course very upset that we still had a problem. We were able to make reservations elsewhere for the remainder of our stay, but one of our party came home covered with terrible bites, requiring a day off from work for a doctor's visit and steroid prescriptions to alleviate the inflamation and itching. Overall, there were a lot of things to recommend this motel, but under the circumstances it was a disastrous stay, and knowing what we do now, we would have moved out immediately upon finding the first evidence of bedbugs. We know that this can happen at any hotel and we thought Heidi was very friendly, responsive, concerned and cooperative, but we heard from one desk clerk that this had been a problem in this room before- if that is true, they need to be more agressive in their monitoring of the rooms. Also, a certain desk clerk needs to be a little less laid back and more customer friendly.",-1.0,,-1.0,-1.0,

The Marina Motel is an excellent value in a good location for anyone who enjoys walking in San Francisco neighborhoods, such as the Marina, and along the edge of San Francisco Bay, which is just a few blocks north of the motel. There are many good restaurants, coffee shops, and other neighborhood commercial establishments nearby, especially along Chestnut Street behind the motel. Although the rooms are small by today's standards, keep in mind that the Marina Motel is a motel of the late 1930s in style and layout, which owners have taken care to respect while modernizing in other ways for visitor convenience and comfort. Although not within walking distance to SF downtown (Union Square area), it's easy to get there by public transportation or driving your own car. Likewise any other SF neighborhood of interest.

1161,"A Great Bargain for San Francisco I have stayed at the Marina Motel many times. For one thing, parking is free in individual covered spaces. That's no small deal because a typical hotel will charge $20 - $30 per night for parking in San Francisco. If you are looking for a Holiday-Inn-style place this is probably not your motel. This is a 1930's vintage motel and that's part of its charm. All the bathrooms have been modernized, and the staff keeps the place very clean. If you can get one of the rooms with a kitchen, it will really help you keep your expenses down by eating a few meals in your room. There are a bunch of great restaurants at various price levels within walking distance of the motel. The staff at the motel are really friendly and extremely helpful. One caveat, I always request a room that is away from Lombard street because it is a heavily travelled street with a lot of noise.",,,,,1.0

It is so convenient for the Chestnut St. shops and restaurants and just a couple of blocks to all that Union St. has to offer.

The motel was also a block away from great restaurants and shops on Chesnut street where we could eat outside with our dogs. The free parking is also a major plus.

I gave it an above average rating because it felt comfortable. I know some of the botique hotels in SF are a bit nicer with nicer touches but this place is a little different.We booked two rooms at the Marina Courtyard Motel. One was $132 for two doubles and the other was $125 for a queen. From the street side on Lombard Street it would be easy to drive by and miss it. But once you turn inside the small driveway you feel like you are in a different setting. Beautiful hanging flowers surround the place giving it an almost surreal setting. You can hear the traffic on Lombard. We have an inside room and whether you have the windows open or shut there is a good chance you will hear the traffic. The rooms are clean and the staff friendly. THe bathroom was clean. Furniture was adequate. Being above ground level you can open all the windows in the room for fresh air. The area is safe and I was able to take a run down to the marina. Anywhere behind the hotel takes you towards the marina. The location is just minutes from the Golden Gate Bridge and the Presidio. Chestnut street is a block over and hosts neat shops and dining establishments. We ate breakfast at Ella's serving the best pancakes around. We also went to a pizza place called Little Star on Divisadero which serves some of the best pizza anywhere. Both places are frequented by the locals. Both places require you to drive.Overall, if you want a true hotel then this might not be the place for you. But if you want something a little different then I would recommend you try this place.

The motel is just one block from Chestnut Street restaurants, bakeries, shops and an old-fashioned movie theatre...very much a neighborhood feel (vs. the touristy Wharf area or the frantic downtown area). You can use the money you save by staying at the Marina to finance some special dinners or a little shopping !",1.0,,1.0,,
1168,"great place We just stayed at the Marina Motel for 4 nights and had an exellent time. We were in rooms 20 and 21 which share a bathroom so it is great for a family or 2 couples. The rooms are a bit small but nicely decorated. Our rooms were in the back corner of the courtyard so they were very quiet. There is enough parking for everybody, it is a tight squeeze at times but really you just want to park once and use the bus when going into town. There is a busstop on Lombard not even a block away but forget about that one, walk one block down to Chestnut and take the number 30 bus into town. It will just about get you anywhere. We did get the coupon for the 2 for 1 breakfast but decided that Judy's was a bit expensive especially when across the street from the hotel (on Divisadero/Lombard) you can have breakfast for about 4 dollars. They aren't very fast but the food was good. There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well so when you don't want to eat in town you can always get something near the hotel. All in all it was a perfect city hotel. You can get to the sightseeing points quickly and easily and there are enough amenities near the hotel (a 24 hr wallgreens for example) as well.",1.0,1.0,,,

1170,"Charming and Friendly We felt like we were staying in a small European Inn with a quiet back courtyard and beautiful wall murals decorating the outside of the Spanish style buildings. Although we were just around the corner from some great people watching at the numerous sidewalk cafes, restaurants and cute little boutiques on Chestnut Street, we were also only five minutes away from Fishermans Wharf. Each room comes with a garage so we took the advice of the front desk person and hopped on the bus for $1.25 to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf and Union Square. The people at the front desk were very helpful and recommended really good local places to eat and the owners golden retriever, Calvin, makes the place feel more like home. The rooms were on the small side but all the flowers in the courtyard made up for it. We were told that the original owner's grandaughters run the place now but he built the motel in the late 1930's for the opening of the Golden Gate Bridge (2 min away by car). The motel was in a really good neighborhood and we walked on the beach to the Golden Gate Bridge and another day to Fisherman's Wharf and took the bus back. Next time we return we want to get a room with a kitchen and we might even bring our dog since a few of the rooms are pet-friendly.",,,,-1.0,1.0

1173,"If you're driving to (or renting a car in) San Francisco... I travel to SF often , and I always stay in a different place and then put my review on this useful website when i return.My most recent stay--at The Marina Courtyard Motel--was excellent. I discovered the place here, but booked my room directly through their website.I paid 89 dollars a night. The motel is located on Lombard Street in the Marina district---this is the long wide busy street full of hotels and motels that leads to and from the Golden Gate Bridge. In fact, the Marina motel was built to celebrate the opening of the bridge, and it does have a unique early 20th century charm, with its Spanish details and courtyard filled with flowers. Ask for a room facing into the courtyard, so you won't be bothered as much by Lombard traffic, though the Marina is at the quieter end of Lombard, close to the park and bridge entrance. The motel is literally two blocks from the entrance to the famous Presido. I jogged every morning there and the big shady forested paths were idyllic. The motel gave us a 2 for 1 breakfast voucher for a really good and popular joint on Chestnut street: an upscale, bustling shopping area right around the corner from the motel.We had an extra car since my friend met me there, and they let us have 2 private enclosed garages for our vehicles for no charge. Try finding that ANYWHERE else in SF. If you drive to SF, this is the deal. The rooms were small but not tiny, and were clean and cozy with nice windows that open into the courtyard. The only thing I will complain about is a personal pet peeve: the use of flourescent light bulbs, which you find here and almost everywhere; they give everything a sickening glow. SO, walk 50 feet from the hotel to the convenient 24 hour Walgreen's Drugstore and spend a dollar or two for your own incandescent bulbs to screw into the lamps and you'll be set (unless u like looking sickly). This is a great find. The staff were super helpful, friendly and accomodating. I will stay here everytime i drive to SF. Note: not all rooms have bathtubs, so ask.",-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0,-1.0

Thanks guys!!!",,,,,1.0
1175,"Greatest Location on the Island!!! I was born on Oahu and know the Islands quite well. When a great deal came available, which included this hotel, we jumped on it! Positive things first: the hotel is in absolutely the best location in Waikiki. It is right on Kalakaua Avenue and looks directly onto the beach and the ocean, with no obstructions. We walked everywhere ... so easy to get anywhere, from the Moana Hotel (just a block or so away), to the local McDonald's on the corner. The staff is quite hospitable and goes out of their way to accommodate requests. We were especially pleased with Argie and Greg. The negative is that the hotel is really 'tired' ... the furniture in the rooms is old and scratched and dented, even though you can see, that at some point, they were lovely black veneer Chinese. The carpets are stained. The elevator is an E ride in Disneyland! We were originally assigned an oceanview room on the third floor, but after one night (and a request from us) we were moved to the sixth floor. You can tell that this hotel was originally a lovely boutique hotel, but needs some TLC (new carpets, furniture, paint) to get it back to where it might have once been. The rooms are small, but that was to be expected, considering the boutique atmosphere.If you are going to Hawaii and expect a 4* atmosphere, this hotel is not for you. If you have a good sense of humor about things and realize that you got a heck of a deal for a grand location and if you are out of the room most of the day and into the night, then go for it.There was nothing like waking up in the morning to the sounds of the birds in the Banyan tree directly across the street waking up, too. And at night, listening to the business of the street below ... and the feeling of the warm Hawaiian breeze ... well, we liked it ... and would do it again.",,1.0,-1.0,,
1176,"Best hotel in Waikiki for the Value! This was my second stay here. I had originally read a review about the staff being friendly and decided to stay here. Its the best hotel for your dollar. Its cheap, conveniently located close to everything. Its got the best price for being right across from the beach. The staff were amazing as always. I would stay here based just on that fact alone. The room attendants are very friendly and courteous. Trust worthy! The front desk staff are over the top. They will do anything for you. Greg helped us out both times that I stayed there and he was amazing. I cant wait to go back and visit. I would highly reccomend this hotel to everyone I meet and would definately go back. If you go ask for greg, he will help you out with anything you need.",,,,,1.0
1177,"nice but... Nice hotel for the price, great location but buyer beware on the cheaper rooms. Standard Interior Room means no windows! These rooms do have frosted jalousie windows in the door which opens to the hallway (which is tiny and open to the outside so there is a chance of fresh air while sacrificing security and privacy). Moderate Hotel Room comes with a lanai (balcony). Cool! Except the view is a blank concrete wall of the parking garage behind the hotel. Sound echoes off this wall into your room making it quite noisy with the door open until later at night when traffic dies down and the ac units are shut down next door. This is the room we had for three days. 'Partial Ocean View means no lanai/balcony and room on the side of the hotel near the back. Probably the best of the cheap rooms but it sure is nice to have a lanai in Hawaii. The best rooms are on the front of the hotel and have full ocean views and lanais. If you plan to stay more than a few days pop for one of these rooms and enjoy the sunset with a nice drink. I suggest a can of Pass-o-guava with vodka poured in... shake and drink... better than the candy sweet tropical drinks at any of the big hotel bars.

The staff was amazing - from tips on food and hiking spots that only locals know, to being very friendly anytime day or night. Trevor at the front desk was the best and helped us beyond what he should have. If you are looking for a 5-star and book this one - you'll be dissapointed. If you don't mind a few cracks on the floor or a stained carpet (since you don't eat off it) this is your place. Central Waikiki, beachside and lots to do in the area. If you like a friendly place to stay and want to save a few bucks - you're at home. We stayed for 6 nights, had not 1 problem the whole time. Breakfast was continental - pastry, fruit, juice and coffee - enough to satisfy your hunger and get out into the fresh air. For our 1 year anniversary - I have to say thanks to the hotel and staff for allowing us to stay and spend our money on the rest of our trip and not the hotel. Sure, the room was small, but we didn't visit Hawaii to stay in the room. The shower was fun and we could see the beach and our TV from the bed. IF you let the little things in life get to you - don't stay here and take away a good thing with your bad review.

I just have to start by saying that the staff at the Aqua beachside are amazing!!! The front desk guys are all so friendly and helpful, anything we needed they did for us and any where we wanted to go, they helped us get there. At first glance the Aqua beachside is definitly tacky.... the pink carpet, walls and even pink fabricated head boards are a little out of date but they are working on doing renos. We later realized that even though it did seem tacky at first... its actually a really cute and has a ton of character. IT may not be the newest or the nicest place Ive ever stayed but it was super cute. Besides the staff the next best thing about this hotel is definitly the location... literally across the street from the beach! You couldnt ask for a better spot. Our first day we walked out the front door a watched a surf competion right on Waikiki beach. So if your looking for a place tto stay that is friendly, cute, cheap, clean and a great location then this is your place.

1183,"Looks like it was a nice hotel...once upon a time I knew a bit about the hotel before heading in, so I wasn't overly disappointed. However, there are some things that the hotel could be doing to make a more pleasant stay for their guests, that they're not doing at the moment. I and two others stayed in two separate rooms for 4 days this July.The desk manager was very polite and helpful...and a looked a little overwhelmed at times. I knew the rooms were on the small side before booking, so that wasn't a surprise. However, I was somewhat surpirsed to see the run down condition of the place. The shower lining was old and leaked, cabinets were chipped, wall paper peeling, etc. Still, for the location and a decent price I can get over that. Other than a filthy looking carpet, the rooms were clean. The decor throughout the entire hotel looked like it was probably FANTASTIC once upon a time, but has since really deteriorated.Housekeeping was hit or miss. Sometimes they'd clean in the bathroom, sometimes not. Sometimes you'd get a replacement washrag and hand towel, sometimes not. When we called the front desk asking, eventually they said they were out. Yet we discovered later....by being nosy and looking in cabinets on our floor...that they did indeed have washrags... ;(I think what bothered me the most was the used mattresses piled in the 2nd floor hallway and also in the outdoor eating area. Not only was this really tacky looking, it could be a potential heath hazard as the rain creates mold, etc in/on the ones outside. It's probably expensive to dispose/move them out, but shouldn't that be a high priority for the owners if they're refurbing? Most people eat the continental breakfast out there on 3 tables that aren't buried by mattresses.One HUGE positive to this hotel is location. It's literally across the street from Waikiki beach. If the current owners stick with it and put the funds into the hotel necessary to bring it back up to the level it once seems like it was, WOW. Right now, if you don't mind clutter, marginal housekeeping, I'd say it's ok for you. Otherwise, pay a little bit more for the other hotels on the same street.",1.0,,,,-1.0

We booked our room several months ago and paid for a beachfrontal facing room with a queen size bed. When we got to the hotel and checked in they informed us that they did not have a room with a queen size bed, but rather a room with two twin beds. This was not a problem for a night or even two. However they were not able to place us in the room I booked at all during our entire stay. This is very sad given that this was our honeymoon and my wife and I did not even get to sleep in the same bed one night. Unfortunately there was nothing I could do about this situation since my booking says in small print that rooms are subject to availability. In addition to the extreme inconvenience of the bed situation, the room was extremely small. It was the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. There was not even a place to to set and open my suitcase, let alone my wife's, except for the bed or on the floor. And, the rooms and the rest of the hotel, including the elevator to the lobby, are old and worn badly. The carpet in the room was gross and dirty, light bulb burnt out in the old lighting fixture on the wall, etc...Aside from these unpleasantries I will say the location of the hotel is excellent without a doubt.

1199,"Amazing Location, with a Little Grime I booked this hotel due to a guidebook recommendation (Oahu Revealed) which gave this hotel a Gem rating, despite some less-than-stellar reviews on TripAdvisor.I booked directly through their website and was happy to find a VIP room rate ($160) that was less than some nice hotels had as their floor rate ($200+). The guidebook recommended the higher floors (8 through 11) - for an unobstructed view over the large banyan tree that is located directly across the street. being on the top floor is most if not all of the VIP room's appeal.I'll start off with the good: The views were incredible!! We had a nicely sized lanai overlooking all of Waikiki... you were looking down on al the action on the entire Kalakaua Avenue strip, the beach, water to the horizon... just amazing! You could scope out an open piece of beach and head downstairs to claim in within minutes (the only delay being the ultra-slow elevator). There was also Hawaiian music being played in the evening under the banyan tree and it was really beautiful music... a perfect complement to a relaxing evening on the lanai. It was worth the price of the room alone.Now the bad: You knew there must be a catch with $160 for this view... and there were multiple catches... a. the room was incredibly small, b. requests made via their special request section on the site were all ignored, c. the exterior of the hotel is really run-down d. the carpets were gross... they were pink colored so the dark patches were very visible... e. the furniture was rickety... the doors on the TV stand were falling apart... f. the shower was stupidly designed so that you had to be 'in' the shower in order to test the temperature... ouch!, g. they had this super annoying tour guide guy working the front door harassing you each time you walked in with lines like hey, where are you come from? - and he was affiliated (in some way) with the hotel!Lots to say there - but, all in all, yes - I'd probably stay there again at that price. Simply, the location + views beat out cheaper options in lesser locations and I'd take the aforementioned downsides to save $200 every night against the four-star options next door.

With 4 different ResortQuest hotels in the area, it's important to know which one you're looking at when you research. I was looking at pics reviews of ResortQuest Waikiki, obviously in error.The location is wonderful, right across from the beach, and a block from the Pacific hotel, 2 blks from the Marriott, and not far from the zoo. The staff is helpful, and It's nice to have the complimentary breakfast (from 7:30-8:30..on the dot!), but that was the best part.Our tiny room faced a blank wall. The carpet was dirty, there was little water pressure on the cold water side, and a bad leak under the sink. The maintenance man said he'd have to shut all the water off to fix it...and said the whole hotel was due to be converted to condos in a month. That explained a lot about the condition of the place.

Yes, it is small, yes it had carpeting that left something to be desired. It was EXTREMELY reasonable for the location, which is fantastic. And as some have written, I found the service to be VERY attentive. The maid worked around our sleeping schedule, which was unpredictable and erratic, and everything we needed or asked for we got. Terri is wonderful. She hugged us when we left. We were ABC's best customers that week and it was right out our door. The beach is literally out the front door. Less than a minute to jump in the water. If I was going to Hawaii to lay in my room this wouldn't be my first choice, but it served my purpose. It is in the middle of everything and we did it all!

You could not have asked for a better location, the staff was wonderful, and the Boutique-styled hotel was a plus! The rooms were small but very clean!My husbaand and I love to travel and we have stayed in a lot of hotels, motels, and time-shares, but we loved this hotel. Once you entered the doors it was so peaceful and pleasant. I agree with those previous travellers that said it was older and a bit warn (carpets), but I found it to be very quaint and comfortable. We would have probably been writing a very different review had we NOT chosen the Ocean-front room. The view was wonderful. The hey is to get a room that looks OVER the big tree in front of the beach. Yes there are bigger and better hotels in Waikiki, but the ones we visited (ie, Royal Hawaiian, Hyatt, Sheraton, various Outrigger Resorts) were so commercial and busy with shoppers. We loved that we could be in the hustle and bustle and then retire to a quiet and small hotel.I have to mention this...The bathroom shower had the best water pressure I have ever experienced. You could stay in the shower for 30 minutes and the water nevered cooled down!!!!(One last thing) The elevator, someone mentioned that it was low...We never had to wait more than 45 seconds for this thing.

We had an oceanfront room so the view was super. However, the hotel is old worn. The showerhead popped off struck my wife on the head, leaving a bruise. The staff was just okay.

1213,"The Little BeachSide Hotel that Could....... This was my first time in Hawaii, so when I got there I wanted everything to be nice and smooth. I bought my packaged deal from Pleasant Holidays and I think they did an overall good job with the booking. Check-in was easy. If your trying to look for this hotel make sure ALL YOUR PASSENGERS ARE LOOKING TO THE LEFT to find the entrance to this club, i mean HOTEL. If you blink, you will certainly miss the hotel because I had to drive around 3 times just to find it. I even went to the wrong Aston Hotel chain and they told me I was at the wrong hotel. I felt so touristy. When I finally got to my hotel, the staff was very friendly. When I saw the elevator to go up to our room, I thought at first if it was the food elevator for room service, but turns out that little elevator was the mode of transportation up to our rooms. Just make sure when you go to the elevator, there isn't a crowd with you unless you want to be rubbing up on someone's tanning lotion. When I opened to the door to my room, my eyes widened with such a surprisement. The pictures on the Internet can really decieve you on how big the room can look. The room is really good enough for 2 people, MAX! I had an ocean-view room fortunately so I had a balcony over-looking Waikiki beach. Thank goshers for the balcony. It saved the room. If it wasn't for the view, I would have developed CLAUSTROPHOBIA on the spot! The room service cleaned our room everyday and made it nice and neat. This service is greatly appreciated after a night of drinking on the patio. The hotel also offers its guests free towels and sand mats for beach use, which became very useful. Location was very good too. ABC store to your right, left, back, front, on the beach, everywhere. Everything is walking distance from this hotel so that saved alot of time driving everywhere. Only problem I had with the location of the hotel is getting on the H1 EAST!!! took me about 2 tries to find the shortest path to enther this highway. Other than that, this hotel did it's job. saved me $ and I got a great view of the beach from it.

1215,"Great Staff, Great Location! As most of the other reviews already mentioned, the staff at this boutique hotel was wonderful. Ricky was always patient and helpful with the many questions we had for him. He also gave us a great deal on upgrading to an ocean view room on the 9th floor (we were supposed to get the windowless room). He and Shane also recommended going through Cheap Tickets to book luaus/tours...as Shane instructed, just look for the lady passing out orange flyers in front of the McDonald's right next door and give Cheap Tickets a call. We booked a luau at Germaine's and snorkeling at Hanauma Bay w/transportation and gear for about $45. Although the hotel warned us not to use Mr. K/Dr. K as our transportation provider to Hanauma Bay (bad customer service and they were right!), they ended up being the company Cheap Tickets deals with for transportation. I requested 6:45AM pick up and the morning of, when I called Mr. K to confirm, he wanted us to take the 8:30AM departure instead since it would just be my friend and I that he would be taking. I stated that we wanted to go early and that when we booked, we were promised a 6:45 pick up...he said the earliest he could come was 7:10AM. He was 15 minutes late and when we got in the car, didn't even say a word to us. I had to repeat a question two times before he even responded. We also requested for pick up from Hanauma at 12:00 but again, he was not flexible because he wanted the car to be full instead of only 2 passengers. I told him that the hotel was kind enough to give us late checkout until 2:00PM so I just wanted to make sure we got back by that time. He said he could only come back at 12:50PM (he then gave us the option of 10:50AM but that didn't give us much time to snorkel the beautiful bay). We didn't get back to the hotel until 1:40PM or so because the shuttle decided to pick up another pair of passengers at Diamond Head who weren't even there!Of course, the hotel staff was kind and understanding about our tardiness because they knew that Mr. K's service is not very reliable or punctual. So if you are on a time constraint or appreciate friendly service, I suggest not going through Mr. K.I would definitely stay at this hotel again...yes the rooms are small but you should be spending most of your time outdoors!

I prefer being at the eastern end of Waikiki (where the Beachside is) and it's proximity to the beach itself, right ACROSS THE STREET, is perfect. The room was small but nice.

We were a little nervous since we booked a room with no windows, but we were on a budget and figured we wouldn't be spending much time in our room anyway. Far and away the best thing about this hotel is the staff. They were as friendly and helpful as could be. I called them and asked about the windowless rooms, and they said that if, upon arrival, there were partial or ocean view rooms available, they would upgrade us for less money than it would be if we booked a partial or ocean view room in advance. It added a little excitement to the experience and when we arrived that was precisely the case. They offered to upgrade us to a partial ocean view for $10 more a night, or to a full ocean view for $20 a night (as opposed to I think $80 if we booked an ocean view in advance.) As other reviewers have said, this hotel lacks bells and whistles, but my thoughts are that in Waikiki you don't need your hotel to have bells and whistles. All of the excitement at this hotel is right out the front door on the beach. This hotel truly could not be in a better location.

There are beach mats and beach towels available at the lobby, just ask from the front desk staff. This hotel is aéˆ¥?no fringeéˆ¥?place; there is no porter or room service. But the hotel location is safe, quiet and good; sits about two blocks away from the beach (less than 10 min walk), just a block away from International Market, quite centrally located in Waikiki district. There is a small pool, laundry room, free parking but the safe box is not free.Our family of 4 stayed in a two-bedroom suite, the lanai view overlooked the street while the bedrooms; one view is the same street, the other is the back of the hotel. My uncle/aunt unit was a studio also with a kitchenette and comes with full length sliding doors(comes with heavy black-out drapes) to their lanai which overlooked the canal, golf course and the mountains. Both units are fully aircon, but if you like fresh air, ilimaéˆ¥æªš strategic location gets excellent cross-breezes and so is well ventilated and fresh.Our 2 bedrooms unit has a large kitchenette, fridge, sitting/TV and lanai area. The kitchenette was fully stocked; kettle, coffee maker, pots, pans, toaster, plates and utensils. Everything was very clean. We used the stove to make breakfast and it was nice that bottled water was provided as well. Rooms are ok but the room doors had a bit of problems éˆ¥?one did not close properly or if you do so, it would required you to use quite a bit of strength to pull it open; the other closes easily but as the bathroom doors opens/closes next to it, the bedroom door will come unlatch from the vibrations. Also it was sometimes noisy for the room facing back of the hotel, as the windows was louvered type (noise is not from the regular traffic as the hotel is along a side street), I was awoken couple of times by the garbage truck making its rounds around the neighbourhood during the early morning wee hours. For my little girl this had no affect and she slept on quite well.My uncle/auntéˆ¥æªš studio was a very large unit too; I would say it was approximately the same size as our two-bedroom suite but minus the 2 bedrooms. Overall, everything was nice, clean and friendly. Next time, based on the room view and noise, Iéˆ¥æª’l go for 2 one-studio unit on the mountain side.Oh, if there are more than 2 people going to the airport, consider using the regular taxi/cab this hotel uses.

A nice little bit of unprofessionalism to start off my stay! So. My wife and I decided to just go walk around Waikiki in the meantime. We arrive back at the Ilima almost a full two hours later figuring we'd be able to get into our room. The answer? It's still not ready. Just have a seat and we'll tell you. I was starting to get very irritated at the fact that it was like 6pm and we were stranded in their lobby. Finally, a full 30 minutes later we are informed the room is ready.We booked for a deluxe one bedroom suite (for $283 a night) and when we got up there, we were appalled. The bathtub was rusty and stained and the whole entire bathroom was obviously not kept up. The bed sheets had stains....STAINS of I don't even want to know. The comforter (if you can call it that) on our lumpy bed had small cigarettes wholes all over it and our room smelled like cigarette as well. Overall, the room, furniture, carpet and curtains were very outdated, rundown and NOT CLEAN. This place was a nightmare! We had booked the DELUXE one bedroom suite because we did not want to make the mistake of booking a regular studio room and having a rundown little room. Apparently at this hotel it didn't matter. We immediatly contacted the front desk and politely informed them of our concerns and asked if they may another a different room of the same category they may have. The girl on the other end was very rude and said that since we checked in so late that there was only one other room in our category we could look at. This new room was more of the same!! My wife and I immediatly set out to look for a new hotel because we were not going suffer for the next 9 nights!After about 2 hours of searching we finally found a much nicer place with new, clean and beautiful rooms at the Aqua Palms. The kicker? We were only going to be paying $150 a night for a much much nicer room at the Aqua Palms.The next morning when we were checking, the girl working at the reception desk made the remark that if we wanted a quality room we should have booked the penthouse!!!!! Based on my stay here, I am under the impression that the staff must be writing the reviews to this site because I honestly have no idea how this hotel has a good reputation!! Anyway, I do have one positive thing to say about the hotel: The check out was very fast! It took about 3 minutes.I would never return to stay here nor would I recommend this place to anyone.",,-1.0,,-1.0,-1.0

1237,"Loved the Ilima! After arriving at Honolulu airport with no hotel booking ringing about 20 hotels that were all full, the Ilima hotel had a room. This hotel is amazing with super friendly staff excellent location. It is just down from the international market place. It is only a 5-7min walk to waikiki beach close to everything else. The 1 small downside may be a small pool with not much sun. We had a 3night stay here from Sat 12Aug'06. The rooms were huge clean we could see some ocean too. We had a kitchenette which was great for making our own b/fast. Would be very happy to stay here again. Highly recommended!",-1.0,-1.0,,,
1238,"Another good stay Having had a good experience in the past with the Ilima, my wife and I returned there this year for our honeymoon, on the front and back ends of a cruise. We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms (studio), but the room was very spacious and airy. The staff is friendly, and I recognized the same people who we met during our last stay.There were a couple elements of our stay that were not as good:1. Noise: If you are not used to the city and city sounds, it may not be easy for you to drill out the sounds that many city dwellers are used to (traffic, the beep beep backup sounds of dumpsters being emptied, and so on. In addition, the airiness of the open-air hallways create a strong draft which causes doors to slam if you're not careful. During our stay, we had some very inconsiderate neighbors who continually went in and out of their door, letting it slam very hard behind them. (At 8AM on vacation, that was annoying).2. Parking: The parking garage fills up quickly when the hotel is busy, but there is overflow parking. The spaces are very tight, and it is extremely easy for your car to get dinged (or worse) by another. If you're not used to small city parking garages, be aware of this. The parking is free, though, which is a great plus!On the positive side:1. You get excellent value for the money2. The older gentleman at the tour desk (when we saw him in the past) was very kind and knowledgeable enough3. The desk staff is very friendly and hospitable, particularly the ones who have worked there longer4. Our housekeeper was very sweet and thorough5. The hotel is an easy walk to the International Market (a bit farther to the beach, though)6. The room was very clean with a newer air conditioner (which we used very little). The kitchenette was fine for a short stay.I detected no funny smells that were referred to in a previous review. In fact, I would take the stairs instead of the elevator down, and it was clean all the way to the lobby. I would not call the Ilima luxurious, but it was clean, safe, comfortable, and reasonably priced, especially for Waikiki. We would definitely return there again.",1.0,,1.0,,1.0
1239,"Wonderful, large and comfortable! My nephew and I enjoyed 5 1/2 days at the Ilima and were so pleased with the accomodations and staff. Everyone was so courteous, friendly and humerous. Our studio #1201 had a fantastic view of the Ala Wai and hills. My nephew enjoyed sitting outside and reading in the early morning.Our room was huge and extremely clean. I read all the previous write ups so we kept our bathroom articles in the large shelved closet outside the bathroom. We stored our empty luggage in the huge storage closet, used the plastic hangars (very nice extra) for wet swimsuits and hung on the shower rod and enjoyed the extra towels we requested each day.The beach mat and beach towels available in the lobby and the proximity to Jack in the Box and Denny's for late night snacks made everything so convenient.Courtni was wonderful to work with at www.ilima.com reservations and Markus, on the front desk, was a wealth of tourist information with a great sense of humor.There are 4 washer and dryers and it's only 75 cents per machine. We didn't use the pool, sauna or exercise room.... no time!The only negative is the narrow parking stalls and I had downgraded to a compact but next time I'm going for an economy car.

1240,"Great Hotel We have stayed at the Ilima hotel numerous times, and have always found it to be worth returning to. On my first stay, and indeed late at night after a long day of travelling I hadnt been very pleased with my first impressions of the hotel rooms which looked less contemporary than the holiday inn type hotels I was used to. If you are looking for a holiday inn type of hotel, you probably will find this to be a slight disappointment. However, after a few days it was obvious that there were many advantages to this hotel. It is not very far from the beach and the shops, but yet far enough that it is quiet and never overly crowded. This is extremely beneficial when you do deal with the front desk or want to swim in the pool as you never need worry about it being too busy which in my books is an absolute treasure on a holiday. As some of the other reviews have pointed out, the pool is smaller than others you will see at surronding hotels, but the fact that you may well end up having the whole pool to yourself seems to much outweigh having a small section of a large one. The staff is friendly and helpful and we have never had any complaints with that area of the hotel. The one thing that I would warn anyone considering this hotel about, is that if you are planning on taking many bus tours, or shuttle services - prepare to be the first hotel of many to be picked up and the last to be dropped off. We learned very quickly that by staying at a smaller less known hotel, that you are low priority for pickups and drop offs, which needless to say can be extremely inconvienient after a long day and has led on occassion to us simply getting off 5 or 6 blocks away at another hotel just to be able to get back faster by walking. Otherwise, we definitely never even consider another hotel when we continue to visit Hawaii as we find the benefits to this hotel definitely outweigh the negatives.",,,1.0,-1.0,1.0
1241,"Nice hotel a bit far from main tourist attaractions Just spend four nights at this property. This is my fourth time in New Orleans and first time post-Katrina and with family. We booked by calling the property directly as we needed two rooms and they were running a second room 1/2 off special. The rooms were nicely decorated. The beds had nice and confomfortable linens. The bathrooms are small at this property. The concierge was very nice and friendly. The only thing I think may need improvement is to have the water and coffee supplies replenished each night by housekeeping. However, be aware that parking is 28 per day, plus tax. We spent most of our time walking to the French Quarter for meals, sightseeing, and shopping. However, there is a nice Cajun restaurant and brewery in walking distance. Overall, very nice property. However, I would not stay here again with children. The crime rate in New Orleans is high and I would eliminate walking long distances after dark with shopping bags and kids (obvious tourists)! I do think that common sense prevails, stay in well lit areas and never talk to strangers. I did see the scam ltaking place around the Natchez that is listed in posts here regarding, Where are you shoes? The scam artists actually said they were part of the Natches (riverboat) crew but they obviously were not. Be careful of stuff like that and you will be fine.",1.0,-1.0,,1.0,1.0
1242,"Somewhat Deceiving On our way back to Texas after traveling to Biloxi Ms to see our son in the Air Force, we decided we would give New Orleans a try after having not been there in about 15 years. I studied all of the reviews in Trip Advisor and chose the Wyndham somewhat due to having Riverfront in the name. I visualized relaxing in my room while watching activities on the river. When I booked the room, I even told them I wanted a room with a river view. The young lady told me they were completely booked but could give me a Superior King Corner for just a little more and I booked it. When we got to the hotel at around noon and were told that the check in time was not until 3:00, which was ok with us since we were going to go walk in the French Quarter anyway. They asked for my cell number so they could call me when the room was ready. I never got a call and we went back to the hotel assuming they just forgot and found out all of the Superior King Corners were still not ready and they suggested one of our normal rooms on the sixth floor with a great big window and the best view of the River. We were tired and accepted. We got to the room and looked out the window and discovered that we looked out over a parking lot (about a 400 car lot) and on the other side of that was the railroad tracks and then the River Front Mall. The only view of the river was a very small peek through a breezeway of the mall. The hotel is only 6 stories tall and so is the mall. In short, if you are wanting a view of the river....it does not happen at the Wyndham Riverfront. Oh and by the way, when I got my bill it was for the Superior King Corner. If you are not looking for a view, it is actually a nice hotel with very comfortable beds and is very clean.",,-1.0,1.0,1.0,
1243,"Fantastic Stay My wife and I just recently stayed at the Wyndham Riverfront in New Orleans and had a great experience. Overall, this is based on our experience with ALL the staff at the Hotel.

From the doormen, front desk, reception, room service, etc, everyone was friendly and very attentive.When we asked for a room change after arriving, we were upgraded and received a suite (we are Wyndham by Request members).We ordered in breakfast on several occasions and the food and the service was very good.I would recommend the hotel for its location as well. It is near the river in a very clean area close to shopping, the French Quarter, and the casino. We had originally thought we would stay in the French Quarter, but after having gone there, we felt we had made an excellent choice. You're close enough to walk but you are able to get away to a quieter area of New Orleans.By the way, take some of the tours while you are there -- we can recommend the plantation and city tours of the Garden District, French Quarter, and Katrina areas.

1248,"Great location Checked in on 12/31/07 and out on 1/2/08. We were in town for the Sugar Bowl and decided to stay outside of the French Quarter to avoid some of the craziness of New Year's Eve. Check in was quick and easy. Help with luggage was great and efficient. The hotel is only 6 stories but has a lot of rooms on long corridors. If you don't want to walk a long way, ask for a room close to the elevators. But ice and vending are at the end of the long winding corridor.Beds were very comfortable and the room was clean with nice amenities including coffee and coffee maker. The do not disturb signs are flimsey and tend to fall off of the door handle. Ours disappeared and the maid was knocking on our door too early in the morning on January 1. She graciously left when asked. The housekeeping staff was very pleasant and did a wonderful job.The walls between rooms seem to be a little thin. From 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. we had a crying baby next door. We didn't use room service and didn't have a chance to eat at the restaurant. On New Year's Eve it was closed for a private party.The hotel is very close to the Convention Center and the River Walk. Also close to Harrah's Casino if you're up for a little gambling. It is a hike to the French Quarter but you can walk it or easily get a taxi or take very inexpensive public transportation. Felt safe in this area.Close to the Bon Ton Cafe and Mother's restaurants. Both are excellent! Be prepared to wait in a line outside to eat at Mother's -they don't take reservations. Overall I would recommend the hotel.

1249,"Great Choice Great location! First let me say everyone told me to make sure I stayed in the french quarters, how wrong they were.The quarters is filled with people and hotel on top of hotel its a great place to visit,shop and eat but when it came time to rest it did not get any better than the Wyndham Riverfront. It sits across the street from the riverfront and streetcars that that takes you everywhere for $1.25 and .40 cents for seniors. The hotel is only six stories high it sits in warehouse district up and trendy where you find galleries and great local places to eat and listen to some great New Orleans music. When I searched the websites looking at hotels I found lots with that old New Orleans feel but that wasnt what we wanted. We wnted something contemporary and new with clean lines. When I saw the picture of white down comforters I knew I had found it and I was right. The hotel was modern clean and very comfortable.The staff was wonderful from doormen,room service, dry cleaning ,maid service and setting up our return flight.

1250,"AAO meeting across the street If you have business at the New Orleans Convention Center, this is the place to stay. A short two minute walk will get you there and it's only about 10 minutes to the French Quarter.New Orleans is trying very hard to present its best face to visitors and it's working. The area around the Convention Center is spotless. I couldn't find a piece of trash on any street. The trees were freshly planted and everything looked fresh. I heard all the homeless now live in Houston and would have to believe that. The streets were filled with only tourists or business people. The hotel informed me they were over-booked when I checked in about 6 p.m. and they would therefore give me only smoking rooms. Since the town was full for the convention, I had no other choice. Try as best I could, the room never lost that stench from smoking and my clothes still reek of it as they hang in my closet at home. Oh well.Otherwise, the staff were very friendly and helpful. I ate several times at the downstairs restaurant and enjoyed quick service, good food and reasonable prices.My maid seemed to have a few problems though, as I often found a lack of hand towels, new shampoo or new soaps upon returning to the room. A call to the front desk fixed all this, but it was a bit of a pain. How much can a new shampoo cost them?The connecting door between my room and the next seemed quite thin. Unfortunately, my neighbor liked to leave his TV on all night to help him ?sleep? and I had to call the front desk one night, as the volume was loud enough to keep me awake. They promptly visited his room and all was quiet for the rest of the evening though. The central location made is easy to wander around downtown at night. The area seemed very safe and well-lit.

(Dragging hubby with me is sort of selfish - it makes the business trip go easier for me) :)What a gorgeous hotel! We stayed at the Hilton Boston Financial District, and being a Hilton Honors member, we received complimentary breakfast coupons for the two days we were there. That was a nice touch.Check-in was mostly hassle-free, though our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so we had to wait about an hour and a half. We had lunch in the hotel restaurant CaliTerra to kill time, which ended up being a really nice treat. I had a personal pizza for lunch, while my husband had a grilled turkey panini that he enjoyed. Upon checking in, the room was immaculate. Gorgeous furnishings, impressively-made bed (I love the Hilton Heavenly beds), beautiful bathroom fixtures/decor; this hotel was beautiful all the way around. There was the bed, a nice sitting area with a TV/armoire, and a comfortable chair and desk.Housekeeping offered turn-down service. They freshened your room as well. That's a great touch, to be honest! To see the bed (which is inviting anyway) dressed for you to snuggle deep into the down comforter with the cold weather howling outside ... it's almost irresistible...Room service was actually the best I've had in a hotel anywhere. I had a fantastic spinach tortellini in a cheese sauce, while my husband had a frou-frou pizza, and we split a caesar salad. Frankie the Yankie delivered our food and was so funny to chat with. The kitchen was actually quick to deliver our meal, I was pleasantly surprised.The workout room was beautifully equipped, though the equipment needed a good cleaning. There were three Precor brand treadmills, two Precor brand elliptical runners, and two recumbent-style Precor brand bikes. Each had an entertainment system with headphones so you could either listen to music or watch TV while you worked out. There were also some free weights and a few pieces of universal-style gym equipment. Unfortunately, there was virtually no room to stretch on the floor or do yoga, though there was a yoga mat. There was also no water within the gym; you had to step out of the gym (take your room key with you) to drink from the water fountain outside the gym.The hotel was located a few blocks from the State Street T, so it was a short walk away, though dragging your suitcase through downtown Boston was tough, with the crappy ruddy narrow sidewalks.

There are also several pubs on Broad Street (I recommend Mr Dooleys!) and a Panera Bread nearby which are all much more affordable and better food than the restaurant in the hotel.The furnishings are very nice, with granite-topped tables and a comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and helpful, from the check-in desk to the cleaning staff that helped me manuever my large suitcase into the elevator on my way out!However, beyond that, there were several things about my room that made my stay less enjoyable. The heating system did not seem to blow warm air despite much fiddling with the thermostat, and the fan would turn on and off very erratically which woke me up throughout the night. There were two windows in my room which would have been very nice, except that they leaked cold air into the room like a sieve. The heavy drapes worked well at blocking the drafts, but it was still very difficult to keep the room warm (and this was in November!). Thankfully there was a down comforter on the bed! The room itself was pretty small too. Not uncomfortably so, but I had a hard time finding a place to put the luggage rack with my extra-large suitcase on it where it wasn't in the way.The bathroom was large, but there was only one hook for towels in the entire room. I would up having to hang my toiletry kit on the handtowel loop, which was kind of awkward. I also conducted a test of their towel reuse program (I try to do this in every hotel I stay in), and marked one of my towels with make-up before hanging it on the one hook. The next day the towels were folded and put away, and the one I had marked was not there. So much for being green. (Although they did convert to CFL bulbs in all the light fixtures, but the inefficiency of the windows probably negated any energy savings they might have had.)If you are traveling to Boston anytime soon, there may also still be construction on Franklin Street, complete with jackhammers and backhoes starting up at 7 am!Lastly, I would note that the toiletries and soaps provided reminded me of my grandmother... very floral and perfumey, and not pleasant to use.Next time I visit Boston, I will be trying another hotel.",-1.0,,,1.0,

Even with the expected higher rates of a downtown location, I found the price per night to be expensive for the room I had. With the hotels close proximity to restaurants and its' downtown location, garbage trucks were out in force beginning around 4:30AM emptying the dumpsters in the area. It was quite loud. And beginning around 6AM the food and service delivery trucks for the restaurants began making their deliveries. From the hotel it is a short walk to a variety of restaurants and bars. Also, it is close to Qunicy Market, Faneuil Hall, Old State House and shopping. For something a little different. we took a water taxi to Logan airport instead of regular taxi. The water taxi can be picked up behind the Harbor Place Hotel (about two blocks from the Hilton), rate is $10, and it drops you off on airport property where you can pick up a bus shuttle to the terminal.

I told him that he was wrong. He said that he'd check with his accounting office and leave me a message the next day. Apparently there was no one after four who could deal with this dilema. When I went back the next day, the clerk told me that the accounting person had called during the day when he wasn't working and asked if I'd like to speak with this person.

A rude young woman at the desk smirked to my husband in mock surprise oh, your family is very large, implying that we were trying to stuff extra people into the room. We should have left the hotel at that point! Our room was very small (even by Manhattan standards!) and very dark- overlooking an interior alleyway. Our ceiling light had a naked bulb -- I asked for a globe to cover it as soon as we entered the room - but when we returned 4 hours later it was still not done. After a second request they finally fixed it. The tub drain did not work properly either. We picked this hotel for the excellent location,but I will never stay there again.

We were in Boston to attend a family wedding and had a total of 8 rooms between 14 people which were conveniently all located on the same floor. Really liked the hotel, the room and bathroom were spacious, clean and well kept. As others have noted room size is really pot luck, we had a pretty decent double room, however my brother who was staying on his own had a room about twice as large as ours! In any case our room size was perfectly adequate for our needs. Beds were large and comfortable and there was a lovely selection of toiletries in the bathroom. Our room was kept clean and well tided and all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Some of my family who were flying back to Ireland on 31 Dec asked for and were given a late checkout free of charge. Location is pretty quiet but there are still a number of restaurants closeby and you can either walk or take a short taxi journey to all sights.There were a couple of irritations during our stay. The water in the rooms cost a hefty $4.50 per bottle. Arriving off a long flight from Germany we didn't have much opportunity to go out and buy cheaper water, so ending up paying $9 for approx. 1 litre of water! In saying that the next evening when we got back to our room, we'd been given a couple of bottles of complimentary water, which was a nice gesture. My fiance was keen to check his emails whilst we were there. The hotel was advertising a rate of $9.99 for 24 hours in-room internet access via the TV (there was a keyboard attached). On signing up for this however it didn't work and when we rang the concierge they informed us that it was unavailable and that we should use the internet in the Business Center at a rate of $10 for 10 mins (which we didn't)!

1291,"Nice but some frustrations I wanted to love the Hilton, and in some ways, I did, but in others, we were disappointed. My husband and I just came back from enjoying two days there relaxing over New Year's, and there were positives. Our room was clean and large by city standards, but I agree with earlier posts that size of room is completely luck of the draw based on what I saw on the floor diagram. The bed was very comfortable, and the location of the hotel was great for being out and about in the city for First Night -- close enough to get there fast but far enough away to avoid the worst of the noise. The staff was great -- helpful and courteous, though we were disappointed that our request for an upper-floor room was not duly noted until we pointed it out, and then we were only put on floor 9 (of a 15 floor hotel). Our room maid was wonderful, however. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fabulous -- a really good buffet though it was part of a package for us. Not cheap if you have to pay separately, but worth it.And that brings me to the negatives. The hotel nickels and dimes you with charges for things that in other hotels might be part of the high rate charged. Wireless internet is on a per-day charge, and if you instead decide that you'll just use the hotel's Business Center, be prepared to pay a minimum of a $10 charge then $1 per minute after 10 minutes. This seemed ludicrous to us who just wanted to check our e-mail. The bottles of water in the room were available for a mere $4.50 each (we bought some of our own nearby for a lot less), and a $80 charge for dinner in the hotel bar when we only had a few drinks and two light entrees seemed really high, even by hotel restaurant standards. In general, it seemed that the four-star rating was not really warranted given how many of the little extras one expects at four-star locales involved extra charges here. In addition, there were some aging issues -- the sheet that had a hole along the edge where it was folded over on our bed; the scratchy towels that were too old to still be soft and fluffy; the slightly worn wood on the furniture like the arm chair and entertainment center. The room was also quite noisy, in part due to the expected city sounds, but also due to how easily we could here our loud neighbors across the hall as they came and went.It was not a bad experience -- in fact, we were quite happy when all was said and done. But with a little more inclusiveness in their rates and some upgrading of slightly aging fixtures, this hotel could more fully embody a four-star experience.",,1.0,1.0,,1.0

One of our rooms was a corner room and I think it was as big as three other hotel rooms would have been. We were hoping for connecting rooms, but they don't have those at all. That was our only disappointment with the hotel.

My room was quite small and faced the opposite wing of the hotel which, if you didn't keep your blinds drawn, would allow people to see inside your room. (Think Jimmy Stewart in Rear Window). The hallways were FREEZING but interestingly my room never got that cold as I usually like to sleep with the air set low. Beds were comfortable and slept well however the water pressure in the shower was a bit unpredictable as well as the temperature which seemed to fluctuate between really hot and really cold. There was also a really noisy vent in the room that seemed to kick on randomly; not sure if it was connected to the a/c or not. My only real complaint with the hotel was the cost of the items in the lobby bar. Don't hotels serve plain old hamburgers anymore? Instead its a goat cheese and roma tomato pizza for 15 dollars. Luckily there are a couple of great pubs in the area, one practically next door however when its raining you wish that you didn't have to leave the hotel.The location was ok. Bit of a walk to the T and Boston Common. I arrived on a Sunday and the neighborhood, being the financial district, was really quiet with no one around.

You can also walk a block or two in the AM to a great bagel place (Finagel a Bagel), among many other casual places to eat and drink. Subway access is extremely close by. No pool (sorry, kids). Also, no safe in the rooms but there is a front desk safe deposit box with 24/7 access.

Our room was on the top floor (15th) with a nice view of the water. I found the room itself to be average--I would have expected more from a Hilton (and our $199 per night price). The carpet was a bit worn as was the chair. The bathroom was tiny and the vanity mirror on the wall was broken. It did look like they were doing some work in the hallways (until almost 10pm one night!) and the lobby so perhaps it will get better.After our first night we spent the day exploring wonderful Boston. Upon returning to our room at close to 4pm we found housekeeping had not been in it. We called the front desk to inquire and they said they'd check and call us. They never called but soon someone from housekeeping showed up and told us we were supposed to have checked out of our room at 3pm that day! We once again called the front desk (they seemed clueless) and were told they'd have another set of keys brought to us which didn't make sense at all. We decided to go down to the front desk and take care of it. We found two staff that both were trying to work on our problem at the same time but the other didn't know it. They ended up getting into a discussion about it right in front of us. We overheard them say another staff member had booked someone else in our room for two nights. After a wait, we were given new keys to the same room. They said they were sorry but that was it. We found one concierge to be quite helpful (Dragona?) and the other not helpful at all.Also note--the walls are thin and there is no soundproofing to the outside. There are many bars around the hotel and it gets really really loud after 2a.m.I don't think we'll stay here again. Our Hampton Inn in Manhattan during the same trip was much nicer, more updated and quieter than the Hilton in Boston.",-1.0,,1.0,,-1.0

1306,"Recommended Not a lot to say other than that we found this hotel to be of an excellent standard. We did not experience any problems whatsoever with the accomodation, staff, location nor anything else. A special mention is deserved for the bed which had the most comfortable and sumptuous mattress I have ever slept on! All in all a hotel that we would not hesitate to recommend and that we would be pleased to stay at again.",1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0
1307,"Not bad... Not AMAZING, but not bad. It did just fine... I have stayed in A LOT of hotels in my life and I just loved how the Hilton has marble bathrooms. It made everything else lacking seem much more luxurious than it probably was.The hotel staff is VERY VERY VERY slow, and though they are nice people, they are not the most accommodating. Upon check in I was given a smoking handicapped access room. Even though that room (for all you needing handicap access rooms) is absolutely GORGEOUS, I really didnt prefer it. So I went back downstairs, told them to give me a king non-smoking, and they agreed. Room was changed in about an hour. Again, very slow staff.The room itself was on the top floor (the 15th), and on the small side, but still nice. The decor was nice, the carpet seemed clean, the room updated enough. The bathroom was ginormous, and the toiletries were complete.Parking is $39/day and only offered as valet. The location is good though a little confusing to find if you are driving. A hint: From the waterfront, find State Street. Once you see Club Vertigo, turn left. That is Broad.Location is literally a four minute walk to Faneiul Hall, and thirty second walk to the first bar. Walkable to the North End, the waterfront, and a bit of a hike to Back Bay.Great location. The hotel itself was fine. Not breathtaking, but suitable for a four star. Didnt leave me in awe, but I approved I guess....",,1.0,,,
1308,"Recommended! We stayed at the Hilton Financial District as a way to spend a few days exploring Boston after a conference.It is wonderfully located, and a sound choice. Not quite to the standards I have come to expect from a Hilton property, but still very comfortable, spacious, and with a fine restaurant. (More like a Doubletree to be honest).I would go back.",,1.0,1.0,,
1309,"Super place, great location to downtown Just back from the Hilton Financial Boston, cannot say enough great things about the place. Gave us a room on 12th floor even could see the water if we leaned a little. Huge refurbished room, thick terry bathrobes, nice marble/chrome bathroom. Only minor complaint was everything was feathers, pillows comforter, and I'm super allergic. They did everything to try and find hypoallergenic ones but too late for the first night (our fault for checking in late). The staff is above and beyond in the service and friendly department. Clean rooms, clean hotel. They serve great coffee in the morning in the lobby area, take a cup back to the room, although there are little 2 cup makers in the room, but that's work! Book thru priceline if you can, it's SO worth it! I could give it a 5 star, but save those for the REALLY REALLY special places, this is in the heart of the city and it's a nice hotel, but not REALLY REALLY special if you see what I mean... The location btw is unbeatable, we were about 10 minutes walk from the Omni Parker House, where there was a wedding attended. The church was another 5 minutes, and it's really a safe area all around... no need to worry even for two single (great looking I might add....LOL) women!!!!!!!!

1311,"Great value We stayed here at the end of April 2007 for 4 nights, having booked through a UK discounted website. We had fabulous service (to the extent any of the staff who had helped us, they would come say hello if they saw us again - the barman even providing some complementary cheesecake when he heard we never ate desserts as we were always too full!). Our room was large (although just a little lacking in light), the bathroom lovely, breakfasts good (get the pancakes without icing sugar if you don't have a sweet tooth) and the location spot on.
